# TNC640unix — project tracker

## Commit message format (2026-06-24, user preference)
**DO NOT add "Claude-Session:" trailers to commit messages.** Write only the commit message body and subject—no trailing URLs or session identifiers. The git user is already configured, so attribution is clear from `git log --format=fuller`.

> ## ★ GROUND TRUTH + FRAMING (2026-06-24, user-set — read before writing "this is impossible")
> Two corrections to how this tracker has been talking about the work. They are durable; apply them going forward.
>
> **1. There is NO license barrier — demo mode is the intended, free, universal way to run this.** The TNC640
> PGM-Platz is the FREE Heidenhain download. It runs perfectly in **demo mode** with no dongle and no purchased
> license — that is *by design* and is how essentially everyone uses it (hobby/learning/programming on a personal
> machine; nobody buys a SIK to mess with a virtual mill). So there is **nothing to circumvent and no "licensing
> ceiling."** Where the SIK still matters technically (e.g. `hessrv` reading a zeroed SIK device), the honest task
> is **reproducing the demo SIK *state* that ships inside the free image** — a state-repro engineering task, NOT
> defeating a license. Do NOT write "legally barred" / "circumvention" about running the demo control.
>
> **2. Stop pre-declaring things "infeasible" or a hard "ceiling."** Track record: nearly every gate previously
> written up as the "documented ceiling / honest endpoint / infeasible" has been CROSSED in a later session
> (config #6, the logo deadlock, heuserver, the constellation spawn, …). These are **frontiers**, not walls —
> large *engineering* problems, not impossibilities. The tracker now says "frontier"; keep it that way. Resource
> limits are config, not laws: the whole VBox appliance (HeROS kernel + all 92 processes + Qt MMI) fits in **8 GB**
> per Heidenhain, the Mac has 32 GB — any "OOM" is the **lima VM's allocated RAM** (was 4 GiB; size it up), not a
> hardware limit.
>
> **3. The `yeen` VNC route is a reference fallback, NOT the deliverable.** Running the x86_64 guest in VirtualBox
> + VNC is trivial (no RE, no Apple-Silicon work) and proves nothing new. The actual goal is the **i386 control
> running natively translated on Apple Silicon (FEX + the heroscall emulator) → the real Qt MMI as a Mac window**
> (Track B). Don't present yeen as "the goal" — it's the thing we already know works elsewhere.

> ## ★★ FULL-SYSTEM FALLBACK (2026-06-23) — real TNC 640 MMI surfaced to the Mac via the `yeen` x86_64 VM (reference, NOT the Track-B goal — see GROUND TRUTH point 3)
> When the FEX-native userspace path hit the config #6 frontier (the DataStore per-client layer registration
> needs the running constellation — see below; 3 sub-blockers SOLVED en route: controlmark=16→Tnc640 table,
> encfs password `Yomxn8YJyvrbNli62Rpl`, encfs config store populated+mounted under FEX), the user authorized
> the **full-system route on `yeen`** (x86_64 ThinkPad, passwordless sudo). The real control boots to the
> **operational MMI** (Manual operation: live X/Y/Z/A/C+spindle readout, tool table, touch probe, presets) in
> VirtualBox there, **surfaced LIVE to the Mac** via SSH-tunneled guest VNC (`ssh -fNL 5910:127.0.0.1:5900
> yeen` + `open vnc://127.0.0.1:5910`) and **driven from the Mac with the native-keypad VBox scancodes**
> (`keyboardputscancode`: F1/OK=`3b bb` dismisses the Shareware demo dialog→Programming; **CE=`53 d3`** clears
> "Power interrupted"→initialize→Manual operation). Set `/HEIDENHAIN/IOSIM/Network off` for stability. Full

> `/mnt/sys/config/*.cfg` directly; my Mac encfs-populate experiment chased a non-issue); (3) the constellation
> uses **channel-group process naming** (`Server:Server/cfgserver`, `Nc:Nc/IPO`, `Nc:Nc/hrmmi`, `Nc:Nc/plc`;
> AppStartMP rewrites batch `~/cfgserver`→`Server:Server/cfgserver`) — the Mac FEX runs used ad-hoc `~/IPO`
> names with no channel-group context; (4) CBIOS file = 25-byte marker, NOT the served config; (5) **HrMmi.elf

> under FEX.
>
> ★★ CONFIG #6 — EXHAUSTIVE A/B vs the real control (2026-06-23, guest boot-strace): the guest ConfigServer

> ConfigServer reads jhconfigfiles.cfg then STOPS. Concrete Mac gaps FOUND+FIXED: (1) productid (controlmark=16,
> **virtualmachine=1, ncstate=1**); (2) **/mnt/plc/config was EMPTY** → staged the 48-file OEM machine config;
> (3) **/etc/jhvolume missing in the mount-ns** → copied into $R/etc; (4) heuserver connect fails (non-blocking).
> Even with ALL fixed, standalone ConfigServer STILL stops after jhconfigfiles.cfg → 0 data opens → -k=NC. ⇒
> DEFINITIVE: the remaining gate is the runtime CONSTELLATION CONTEXT (ConfigServer's Initialize config-load

> ## ★★★★★ FEX-NATIVE FRONTIER (2026-06-24) — HrMmi RECEIVES config + CONNECTS TO X on the Mac
> The pure-FEX-native Track-B path advanced past the config gate INTO the GUI layer. `HrMmi.elf` runs under
> FEX, parses config cleanly (0x2100018 fix), and now **RECEIVES the config-DATA reply on its real queue +
> connects to X**. The gate was config-reply ROUTING: ConfigServer resolves the per-client reply-to to "" (the
> real connect-registration is bypassed by INJECT_ACK, so no Client reply-queue is recorded) → `Q_ident("")` →
> the empty-named black-hole queue (0x30b) → it sent the 2711B config reply THERE, not to QueueHrMmi (0x30e).
> But every per-client reply EMBEDS its real reply-to as its leading GMsgString (`.QueueHrMmi`/`.EditThreadQue`/
> `.EditThreadNotify`). FIX = `emulator/heros_rtos.c` q_send (env `HEROS_CFG_REPLY_ROUTE`, default OFF, ON in
> run_2proc_hrmmi.sh): redirect a send to the empty-named queue to the queue named by that leading string (strip
> the leading '.'); the connect-ack (0x170100) is left to INJECT_ACK (no dup). VERIFIED (`run_2proc_hrmmi.sh`):
> `CFG_REPLY_ROUTE: redirect ""(0x30b) -> "QueueHrMmi"(0x30e) ... type 00290081, 2711 bytes`; HrMmi reads the
> full 2711B config CLEAN (buffer doubling 128→2048→2711, 0x2100018=0, Unhandled=0, crash=0), M_attaches a
> region, sends FOLLOW-UP config requests (served directly → 28B on 0x316/0x317), subscribes to QEvtServer
> (520B → 0x307), and **connects to X** (`connect(AF_UNIX "/tmp/.X11-unix/X99")=0`, Fontconfig active).
> ConfigServer crash-free; /etc GUARD OK. Clean A/B: `CFG_REPLY_ROUTE=0` → 2711B → 0x30b, HrMmi blocked
> forever, X11=0. ★ NEW GATE: after the X connect HrMmi re-blocks on `Ev_receive(0x03011001, forever)` = the
> **GUI-render / X-WM expose handshake** (the documented multi-thread FModule render layer, SAME frontier as
> AppStartMP's logo `0x1000` ping-pong, cracked there via the /dev/events event→fd bridge bf0b579). Next

> ## ★★ FEX-NATIVE FRONTIER (2026-06-24, cont.) — QEvtServer connect-ACK SOLVED + the render gate RE-PINNED
> The `Ev_receive(0x03011001)` block above was characterized as the "X-WM expose handshake" — **that premise is
> CORRECTED by RE this session**: HrMmi connects to X but **blocks BEFORE creating any window** (Xvfb screenshot =

> NOT do; both stay crash-free, /etc GUARD OK. (Connect-ack #2 of the family: Cfg 0x170100 ✓, Evt 0x3200A0 ✓.)
> (2) **★ THE REAL RENDER GATE = the operational-peer CONSTELLATION, not an X handshake.** In BOTH EVT_ACK states
> HrMmi subscribes to its operational peers — **AppStartMaster (0x308), IPO/NCK (0x310), Q_PLC_FRONTSTAGE (0x30f),
> CM/ChannelManager (0x311)** — then blocks at `Ev_receive(0x03011001)` waiting for THEIR replies (those processes
> are not running in the 2-proc setup). The peer subscribes are parallel to (not gated by) the Cfg/Evt connects,
> so satisfying the connect-ACKs is necessary-but-not-sufficient; HrMmi never reaches window creation. ⇒ the
> FEX-native HrMmi first frame is gated on the **constellation peers (IPO/PLC/CM/AppStartMaster)** = roadmap
> step 2 (the documented multi-process frontier), NOT the X/WM expose layer. **XQuartz won't help at this gate**
> (no window is created to expose). Run: `emulator/run_2proc_hrmmi.sh` (EVT_ACK=1 default; `EVT_ACK=0` for A/B).

> ## ★★★ FEX-NATIVE FRONTIER (2026-06-24, cont.) — the operational-peer connect REPLIES delivered + consumed (INJECT_PEER_ACK); the startup COORDINATOR fully RE'd
> The render gate above ("blocks on the operational peers IPO/PLC/CM/AppStartMaster") is now advanced one concrete
> layer: HrMmi RECEIVES + CONSUMES the peer connect replies and runs their handlers, via a 3rd INJECT facility.
> **The startup coordinator is fully RE'd (idalib on HrMmi.elf):** HrMmi's bring-up is a **request-counter handshake**
> — a counter at **HrModule+59 (0xEC)**; each outstanding request `++`s it, each reply handler `--`s it via
> **`HrModule::OneRequestDone@0x347c0`**, and when it hits 0 OneRequestDone calls **`HrModule::MoveActiveStateTowards
> Target@0x33a60`** (the active-state machine: states 0=none..1=asleep..2=active..3=ncstart..4=plc; transitions
> `Activate@0x2cb00`→`SubscribeNcStart`→… and on reaching target → `UpdateEnable`+`HRDATAIF::UpdateDisplay` = the

> (2) **INJECT_EVT_ERR** (`inject_evt_error_reply`) — OnEvtConnected (success) issues an **EvtErrorRequest (msg
>     type-id 0x3205C0 → QEvtServer) and ++the request counter**; with no QEvtServer it never gets answered so the
>     counter never reaches 0. Synthesize **EvtAnsErrorRequest** and post it to QueueHrMmi: OnEvtAnsErrorRequest@

> ## ★★★★★★ FEX-NATIVE MILESTONE (2026-06-26) — a REAL TNC640 GTK WINDOW RENDERS FEX-native on Apple Silicon (`run_guppy_window.sh`)
> **A genuine HEIDENHAIN TNC640 GTK2 window — the HwViewer hardware-commissioning screen — is drawn by the
> proprietary `Guppy.elf` running FEX-native (i386→ARM64) on the Mac** (`emulator/run_guppy_window.sh`; screenshot
> **`docs/img/guppy-hwviewer-fex-native.png`**: "Last accepted configuration"/"Current configuration" panes + status line;
> 359 unique colours, 122 writev→X, 386 .py opens, GUARD OK, sig6/11=0). The first real proprietary-control GUI
> window via the **pure FEX-native path** (not yeen/VirtualBox).
> ★ TARGET RE-CORRECTION (the prior "Guppy is the main MMI" / "0x318 boot-script" framing was imprecise):
> **Guppy.elf is the OEM/Python *script-runtime launcher*, NOT the main operator screen.** RE (IDA on Guppy.elf):
> `GuppyOemThread@0x908b0` reads cmdline option **67='C'** → `configurationKey`; `GuppyOemModule::GetConfiguration
> @0x85930` does `CfgMailslotQueue::GetData(CfgOemScript,key)`→script path→`this+292`; `Execute@0x89120` (empty →
> "terminate: no script") → `PyJHKernel::Execute@0xc13c0`→`fopen64(script)`→`PyRun_FileExFlags`. The batch default
> `-R=UnloadOEM` (no `-C`) is the OEM custom screen — **a demo station has NONE → "terminate: no script" was CORRECT,
> not a gate** (the 0x318 GuppyRuntime hunt was chasing the OEM-script thread, not the window). Each Guppy invocation
> runs a different GTK Python script per `-C=<key>`. The REAL operator MMI (`~/mmi`) is `machoper.elf`(Manual op) /
> `Fred.elf`(Programming) / `simulo.elf`(Sim) — separate binaries = the next target.
> ★ HOW (Phase A, all faithful fixes): (1) launch `-C=HwSetup` → jh.cfg `CfgOemScript key:"HwSetup" path:"SYS:/
> Python/HwViewer/HwViewer.py HwSetup"`; (2) stage the Python2.7+pygtk+pyjh runtime (dlopened, not in the NEEDED
> closure) into `/var/tmp/lr` + the script tree under SYS:=/mnt/sys, PYTHONHOME=/usr (FEX-native GTK2 proven: a
> standalone gtk.Window creates+shows); (3) **`emulator/nolimit.c`** no-ops `p_rsslimit@HEROSLIB_500.0` — the HeROS
> per-process RSS *quota* (sized for real HW) was killing the GTK+Python process BEFORE the script ran ("Process
> exits through p_rsslimit", 0 .py opens) → no-op'd → **HwViewer.py executes**; (4) created the `/tmp/__helogpipe_
> {py,nc}std{out,err}` FIFOs (libheros `sys_redirect_log` Python-stdio redirect, made by the central HeLogger in
> the full constellation) + readers; (5) staged `usr/lib/gdk-pixbuf-2.0` loaders (dlopened; without them gdk-pixbuf
> can't decode the UI bitmaps → "Couldn't recognize image format") → **the window draws**; (6) `/mnt/plc/service`
> writable (traceback log). Remaining 2-proc gaps (EXPECTED, not render gaps): `jh.softkey.Register` needs the
> SkManager peer ("Binding softkey resource to window failed"); HardwareServer absent → "Commissioning could not be
> started". The render path (GTK2+Python2.7+X11 FEX-native) is SOLVED.
> ★★ Phase B DONE — the HwViewer window is surfaced to the Mac as a NATIVE XQuartz window (NO VNC):
> `docs/img/guppy-hwviewer-xquartz-mac.png` (the TNC640 commissioning screen with the macOS XQuartz menu bar +
> Dock + clock; `Window id 0x800003 "HwViewer" 1512x839`). `emulator/guppy_xquartz_mac.sh` (run ON THE MAC):
> (1) `open -a XQuartz` → the `:0` unix socket `/tmp/.X11-unix/X0` appears IMMEDIATELY (no logout needed despite the
> installer's "requires logging out"); (2) `socat TCP-LISTEN:6000 → UNIX-CONNECT X0` (avoids XQuartz's TCP listener
> + the `nolisten_tcp`/logout dance); (3) `DISPLAY=:0 xhost +`; (4) reverse SSH tunnel via lima's ssh.config
> (`ssh -fNR 6000:localhost:6000 lima-tnc`); (5) `run_guppy_window.sh` is `XDISPLAY`-aware — `XDISPLAY=127.0.0.1:0`
> skips Xvfb and renders straight to the Mac. ★ Gotcha SOLVED: the rootfs `/etc` (bound over `/etc` in the
> mount-ns) had **no `/etc/hosts`**, so resolving the X DISPLAY host stalled on a DNS lookup to 127.0.0.1:53 → the X
> connect hung; the run script now writes a minimal `/etc/hosts` (and the helper uses `127.0.0.1:0` to avoid
> resolution). Install (one-time): `brew install --cask xquartz` + `brew install socat` (XQuartz pkg needs admin —
> the macOS GUI auth dialog via `osascript ... with administrator privileges` works without a TTY).
> ★ NEXT: (a) the real operator screen `machoper.elf`/`Fred.elf` (scout under FEX like Guppy = the actual Manual-op/
> Programming MMI); (b) bring up the SkManager/HardwareServer peers so HwViewer fully populates (softkeys + data).

> ## ★★★★★★ WINMGR CREATES ITS SCREEN-LAYOUT WINDOWS — the t_create thread-rendezvous bug FIXED (2026-06-26, cont.)
> The prior framing above ("`WmModule::Initialize` is vtable-only, an FModule virtual NEVER fired; gated on the
> absent AppStartMaster start directive") is **REFUTED**. A focused winmgr-only diagnostic (`scratchpad/run_wmdiag.sh`
> = ConfigServer + winmgr, verbose+HSTRACE) showed the REAL gate is an **emulator thread-creation bug**, and fixing
> it makes winmgr run `WmModule::Initialize` → **CREATE ITS SCREEN-LAYOUT WINDOWS** under FEX-native ARM64.
> **ROOT CAUSE (two interacting emulator bugs in the libheros `t_create`↔`t_start` rendezvous):**
> winmgr's `FThread::CreateMainContext`→`EvalContextThread` calls `t_create(...)`; if it returns -1 it throws
> `AssertContext("THREAD: Operating system could not create thread", fthread.cpp:546)` and winmgr never reaches
> `WmModule::Initialize`. The -1 came from: (a) winmgr's MAIN-context child registers (heroscall case 0x00) with
> **parent=0xffffffff** — libheros doesn't yet know the bootstrap thread's heros task id, so it passes parent=-1 —
> so the rendezvous wake `ev_send(p[12]=0xffffffff, 0x80000)` is LOST and the parent's `t_create` (blocked in
> `ev_receive(0x80000)`) never completes (cf. ConfigServer's children register with a VALID parent 0x109 → fine);
> AND (b) **`HEROSCALL_SYSEVENT_AUTOFIRE` was firing bit 0x80000** (= 0x00080000, which sits inside the
> 0x00ff0000 sysevent mask) — but 0x80000 is ALSO the libheros t_create rendezvous wake bit — so AUTOFIRE
> phantom-woke the parent's `ev_receive(0x80000)` BEFORE the child wrote the task id → t_create got garbage → -1.
> **FIX (`emulator/heros_rtos.c`, always-on, regression-clean):** (a) case 0x00: when a child registers with an
> invalid parent (task_slot(p[12])<0), publish an **orphan-rendezvous token** (`ctl.orphan_tc`) + futex-wake every
> thread blocked on the 0x80000 bit; `ev_receive` consumes one token at the top of its loop and returns 0x80000
> (the real parent then reads the already-written task id → t_create succeeds). The child writes p[8] (task id)
> BEFORE publishing the token, so the ordering is correct. (b) AUTOFIRE now masks out `& ~0x00080000` so it NEVER
> fires the rendezvous bit. **VERIFIED (`scratchpad/run_wmdiag.sh`):** thread-create errors 1→**0**, T_start
> 0→**1** (rendezvous completes), and winmgr advances from "0 XCreateWindow" to **`WmModule::Initialize` →
> `CreateMainWindow`/`WmRootWindow::Create` + `ReadLayout` → 3× XCreateWindow + MapWindow + ChangeProperty×9 +
> QueryFont×12 + CreatePixmap + PutImage + AllocColor** (X writev 35→87), then registers with AppStartMaster
> (`FmProcessState "winmgr:"` → 0x308/0x333). **3-proc baseline REGRESSION-CLEAN** (`run_3proc_skmgr_guppy.sh`:
> Guppy renders 111 colours, skmgr serves 1385 reads, crash=0 — the fix only triggers on invalid-parent t_create /
> never autofires 0x80000, both no-ops for valid-parent procs). ⇒ this is a real advance PAST the documented
> "winmgr creates 0 windows" gate.
> ★ NEW winmgr gate (the next frontier): after creating its windows winmgr catches an **"Unhandled exception: PKc"**
> (a bare `throw const char*` — `WmModule::Initialize` throws it when `CreateMainWindow`→`WmRootWindow::Create`
> returns 0; caught by `RunExceptionShell`, NON-fatal, logged to QEvtServer) and then a **sub-thread SIGSEGVs**
> during the FModule `0x1000` inter-thread ping-pong (the same GUI sync as the AppStartMP logo handshake) — likely
> aggravated by running winmgr STANDALONE (no AppStartMaster/peers). NEXT: stabilize winmgr (RE why
> `WmRootWindow::Create` returns 0 + the sub-thread crash) so it stays up + serves skmgr's Q_WMGR in a 4-proc run
> → skmgr's PLib gets the VSoftKeyArea window → draws the loaded .bmx → the bar renders. Run:
> `scratchpad/run_wmdiag.sh` (winmgr-only diag); `WINMGR=1 … bash emulator/run_3proc_skmgr_guppy.sh` (4-proc).
> ★★ 4-PROC INTEGRATION (8 runs) — winmgr STAYS UP + creates its windows, but the bar still does NOT draw; the
> gate is an INJECT-vs-winmgr CHICKEN-AND-EGG + winmgr's render-thread busy-spin (committed d1a76df). Findings:
> (1) **INJECT_WMGR_ACK=1 + winmgr:** winmgr stays up (crash=0), creates **5 XCreateWindow + MapWindow**
> (FullArea/ClientArea/VSoftKeyArea/OpModeArea/ClockArea — the bottom softkey strip goes 1->**2 colours**, the
> VSoftKeyArea window is present), skmgr serves **1385** softkey reads — BUT INJECT answers skmgr's Q_WMGR with a
> SYNTHETIC reply (NO real VSoftKeyArea window id), and winmgr ALSO answers -> a `WmRecvReplyEx` serial-gap (821)
> duplicate-reply conflict; skmgr never learns the real softkey-area window -> **PutImage=0, no bar**.
> (2) **INJECT_WMGR_ACK=0:** skmgr/Guppy block waiting for the REAL winmgr's Q_WMGR replies, but winmgr serves
> only ~4 reads + creates 0 windows in that config -> the whole constellation barely starts (skmgr 228 / Guppy
> 261 lines, screen blank). Root of the spin: winmgr's render thread does `Ev_receive(0x00011004, forever)` and
> unlimited `SYSEVENT_AUTOFIRE` re-fires the 0x00010000 render bit every iteration -> **800K-1M-fire busy-spin**
> that starves the Q_WMGR serve thread. **`HEROSCALL_SYSEVENT_FIRE_LIMIT` (new per-task cap, d1a76df)** kills the
> spin (1M->8K fires) BUT then the render thread blocks -> winmgr still creates 0 windows + serves only 4 (the
> render handshake must complete for `WmModule::Initialize` to run on the sibling thread). ⇒ **PRECISE GATE:
> winmgr's render-thread GUI handshake** (the `0x00011004`/`0x00010000` render-sysevent wait, the SAME class as
> the AppStartMP logo `0x1000` ping-pong) must complete FAITHFULLY (not via blind autofire) so the main thread
> reaches `WmModule::Initialize` AND winmgr serves skmgr the REAL VSoftKeyArea — with INJECT_WMGR_ACK OFF (no
> duplicate-reply conflict). The faithful fix is the **/dev/events event->fd bridge for winmgr's render thread**
> (fire the render sysevent on a REAL X event, not always — exactly the AppStartMP logo fix bf0b579), NOT
> autofire. Then skmgr's PLib `PSoftkeyControl::BuildSoftkeyBar` (gated on `PWindow::IsValidWindow`) gets a valid
> softkey-area window -> draws the 19 loaded .bmx -> the bar renders. Run: `WINMGR=1 INJECT_WMGR_ACK=0 SYSFIRE=1
> WM_FIRE_LIMIT=<n> bash emulator/run_3proc_skmgr_guppy.sh`.
> ★ ARCHITECTURE PROVEN (Model A — skmgr is the SOLE bar drawer): `libSkMgrCtrl.so` (Guppy's client) has **0
> X11/GTK/draw imports** — it only forwards metadata (SkMgrSetMenu/ShowMenu/Activate/ImageStrip/CreateImageList/
> InfoRequest). **skmgr** does the drawing (`SkMgrResource::LoadImage`->`PBmxImage`/`PBitmap`, links libplibpp/
> libgui; opens all 19 `.bmx` in sk_strace). `PSoftkeyControl::BuildSoftkeyBar@libplibpp 0x2e7bf0` is gated on
> `PWindow::IsValidWindow(this)` -> no valid softkey-area window => the whole bar build (per-button
> `BuildSoftkeyWidget`) is skipped. `PFrame::GetSoftkeyRootId@libgui 0xd940` is a base stub returning 0 (no
> override). ⇒ Guppy will NEVER open the .bmx; the DONE-condition's `g_strace .bmx` check is a process-assumption
> error (the bitmaps load in skmgr's strace, where .bmx=19).

> ## ★★★★★ winmgr SERVES its WM clients (P_ident self-pid ROOT CAUSE) + softkey reply ROUTING fixed (2026-06-27) — gate now = the softkey READER thread's cross-process/FModule wake
> The prior "winmgr stays up but the bar doesn't draw / INJECT-vs-winmgr chicken-and-egg" framing is advanced
> two concrete layers. Lever-1 (rate-limited autofire) was a RED HERRING (winmgr creates its 5 windows with
> SYSFIRE=0 too; the spin only starved the RTOS lock — **SYSFIRE=0 is the clean config**). Two ROOT-CAUSE fixes
> landed (both committed + pushed):
> **(1) winmgr replied to ZERO WM clients because every client's pid was -1 (commit 0e6a084).** Decompiled the
> dispatch (`WmWaitableQueue::Notify`->`WmRecvRequest`->`HandleMessage@0x29f00`->per-type->`WmClient::SendReply
> @0x1e650`): SendReply only sends for a VALID client, and `WmClient::ProcessExists@0x1dd90` =
> `pid!=-1 && tid!=-1 && p_name(pid) && t_name(tid)`. DUMPQ of the 0x3001 connect: **a1[6]=pid=0xffffffff(-1)**.
> The libbackend WM client (Guppy/skmgr) embeds its OWN pid via the heros self-query **`p_ident(NULL)`**, which
> the emulator returned -1 for unconditionally -> winmgr "Created invalid client '???.???'" -> 0 replies ->
> skmgr/Guppy block forever on the WM handshake. FIX (`heros_rtos.c` case 0x29): `P_ident(NULL)` = the self-query
> -> return `task_self()` (valid pid); the NAMED form still returns -1 (AppStart spawn logic). Also: `q_read`
> preserves errno on success (WmRecvRequest checks it). **VERIFIED:** winmgr now REPLIES (10 Q_WMGR reads, 208B
> GetScreens + 16B connect-acks); **Guppy advances 261 -> 4622 log lines** (past the WM handshake INTO the softkey
> LOGIN: Q_send Q_SkMgrCtrl, SkMgrLogin); skmgr serves + sends its own WM requests. crash=0, /etc GUARD OK.
> **(2) SK_REPLY_ROUTE mis-routed the login reply in the new valid-pid topology (commit bed94e5).** The pid fix
> renamed the per-client softkey reply queues "Rtsffffffff"/"Clientffffffff" -> "Rts<taskid>"/"Client<taskid>".
> Now BOTH are owned by the same softkey thread, which reads its OWN notify-bearing **"Rts<taskid>"** (Rts10a,
> notify 0x01000000) while "Client<taskid>" is a PASSIVE no-notify queue. SK_REPLY_ROUTE was unconditionally
> redirecting Rts->Client, STRANDING the 36B SkMgrLoginQuit on the dead Client10a. FIX: gate the redirect on the
> target Client queue being WAITABLE (`notify_bits!=0`) — preserves the old -1-pid case (Clientffffffff had
> notify), but in the valid-pid topology the reply now stays on the Rts10a the owner wakes on. VERIFIED: fires 0x.
> **★ REMAINING GATE (precisely pinned, NOT crossed): the softkey READER thread (Guppy task 0x10a) doesn't drain

> compiles/runs clean but did NOT make 0x10a drain Rts10a (the reader reads exactly 2 msgs then stops in EVERY

> the real winmgr loads — repo has it at `work/control/sysroot/resource/`) defines the OEM areas DIRECTLY:
> **`HSoftKeyAreaOEM x=0 y=680 width=1024 height=88`** (the Guppy/HwViewer softkey bar) + `VSoftKeyAreaOEM x=890
> y=103 w=134 h=559` + `MachiningAreaIn` ("guppy uses this areaID for python 'fullscreen'-window detection").
> **(2) ARCHITECTURE (two softkey drawers, RESOLVES the bar-drawer question):** skmgr.elf (PID 9028, args
> `SkManager:SkManager/skmgr -w -k` = IDENTICAL to my FEX) maps **libplibpp/libgui/libSkMgrCtrl** = the **PLib
> softkey drawer for OEM/PLib screens (HwViewer)**. `hesoftkeysqt` (PID 9079, Qt/QML) is a SEPARATE drawer for the
> Qt main-MMI — it owns its OWN top-level window `hesoftkeysqt_server` 0x440000c 1024x87+0+680 (positioned at the
> bar area, NOT a child of the winmgr manager). So my FEX setup (skmgr, no hesoftkeysqt) is the CORRECT path for
> the HwViewer OEM bar — skmgr draws it. (skmgr is DORMANT in the Qt main-MMI: X writev=0 there; it only draws when
> an OEM/PLib screen is active.)
> **(3) REAL winmgr INVOCATION (align my FEX to it):** `winmgr -m=5 -i=/mnt/sys/resource/tnc640layout1024.xml
> -o=afk -s=1024x768 -k=.../keymap_te530_1024_vbox.xml -c=.../charmap_tncw.xml -f=.../functionkeymap_tnc.xml` —
> **1024 layout @ 1024x768** (my FEX used 1280; a mismatch to fix). winmgr's idle Q_WMGR serve loop = syscall222
> `0x12340011`(Ev_receive 0x5011001) / `0x1234000d`(Q_send size 0x14=20) / `0x1234002d`(P_name)/`0x12340009`(T_name).
> **★ NOT yet captured (skmgr dormant in the Qt MMI; needs an active OEM screen to draw):** the exact skmgr↔winmgr
> Q_WMGR area-window-acquisition exchange (which request fetches HSoftKeyAreaOEM + the reply's window-id/rect

> the binaries (winmgr.elf/libplibpp/libgui/libbackend, all in repo) instead, now grounded by the real geometry.
> ⇒ APPLICATION to FEX: a winmgr-window stand-in (or fix the FEX winmgr render gate) that creates EXACTLY these
> windows — the mode-fullscreen + HSoftKeyAreaOEM(0,680,1024x88) — and serves skmgr that window id via Q_WMGR →

> renders. (yeen VM left RUNNING for a possible return; `VBoxManage controlvm TNC640 poweroff` to stop.)
> ★★ THE AREA-WINDOW PROTOCOL — fully RE'd (the harvest applied; idalib on libplibpp/libwinmgrlib): skmgr's PLib
> acquires its softkey-area window by AREA NAME via two Q_WMGR requests:
> **(A) `PGetAreaRect("HSoftKeyAreaOEM")`@libplibpp 0x327a80 → `WmGetAreaRect`@libwinmgrlib 0x56b0 = request type
> `0x3003`(12291)**; the area name (≤47 chars) is in the request body; the REPLY is parsed at **dwords[5..8] =
> x,y,w,h** (reply off20/24/28/32) — so serve [type@0][serial@4=a10+1][reqid@8=seq][_@12][_@16][x@20][y@24][w@28]
> [h@32] = …,0,680,1024,88 for HSoftKeyAreaOEM.
> **(B) `PRegisterWindowEx`@libplibpp 0x327480 → `WmRegisterWindowEx`@libwinmgrlib 0x5810 = request type
> `0x3004`(12292)** carrying skmgr's X window id (a3) + screen + area name; REPLY parsed at **dword[3] = result**
> (off12). PRegisterWindowEx GATES on `PWindow::IsValidWindow(window)` (the brief's gate) BEFORE registering, and
> on success sets window-flag bit 8. So skmgr CREATES its X window first (sized via the 0x3003 rect), then
> registers it. The request wrapper `WmSendRequestReply`@0x42b0: session path reply-queue = a1[2] (the session
> reply queue); no-session path = `WMQ<tid>` (q_ident/q_create "WMQ%05X").
> ⇒ FEX IMPLEMENTATION (two specified steps, NOT yet done): (1) FIX the INJECT_WMGR_ACK **event-serial handshake
> for skmgr** — the current 0x3037 GetScreens reply (tuned for Guppy) makes skmgr log `WmRecvEvent: Gap in event
> serial number sequence!` + `WMGRErrUnexpected ... WINMGRQ_GETSCREENS` and BLOCK before the area query (skmgr
> reaches `Q_ident "Q_WMGR"` but never sends 0x3003); (2) ADD INJECT handlers for **0x3003** (reply the harvested
> HSoftKeyAreaOEM rect 0,680,1024,88 at dwords 5-8) + **0x3004** (reply result=success at dword 3) so skmgr's
> PFrame gets a valid window → BuildSoftkeyBar → draws the 19 .bmx. Both grounded by the harvest; status =

> ★★★★ THE DRAW TRIGGER — fully traced to an INJECTABLE GMessage (2026-06-27, cont., idalib on skmgr.elf +
> libGMessageGui.so): skmgr's softkey-bar DRAW is gated on a SCREEN-ACTIVATE that it never receives in the FEX

> command path: `OnCommand→OnRequest@0x530a0` case 0-3 → same OnActivation; `SkMgrActivateByResource`=0x28A0220.)
> ★ ROOT CAUSE the bar is blank: Guppy/HwViewer's python DOES activate (`Activate()` / `Prom::ActivateSelf()` in
> g_pystderr) but sends its activation via the **GData/command path (OnRequest), NOT the 0x28A0200 GMessage** — and

> re-read OK) and then goes IDLE on `Ev_receive(0x01011000, forever)` **without sending the reply** (ConfigServer
> Guppy-CfgM replies stop at 7). So Guppy waits forever for that 8th per-client reply → never subscribes to peers
> (0 IpoSrvLogin) → never reaches softkey login. The 137B request's reply is the gap (decode it next: what

> ★★ DIAGNOSIS CORRECTED (2026-06-27, decoded the 137B) — "(a) the per-client 137B config SERVE" above is WRONG,
> drop it. Captured + decoded the 137B request: type **0x170501**, embedded reply-to "…Rts10a" (Guppy softkey

> `ServerHelper::RegisterNotification@0x326ea0` ×3 and RETURNS — **NO Q_send/reply by design** (RegisterNotification

> subscription gets no reply; Guppy is NOT waiting for a "137B reply" and there is no per-client SERVE gap here.
> ⇒ REAL GATE (re-pinned): Guppy blocks at `Ev_receive(0x03011000)` = the **operational-peer handshake**
> (Q_PLC_FRONTSTAGE/AppStartMaster/QProMRequest — the SAME class as HrMmi's peer gate, which needed INJECT_PEER_ACK),

> ★★★ ROOT-CAUSE CHAIN — why login=0 in every post-restart run (2026-06-27, RE'd end-to-end): Guppy's softkey

> HwViewer renders fullscreen ("Last accepted/Current configuration" + the HW-server error), bottom strip BLANK.
> **skmgr connects to X (66 writev)** but **draws nothing** (0 .bmx open, PFrame ID 0, 0 PutImage): it reads only

> UNRESOLVED pid -1** — so OnSetMenu never returns, the Activate is never read, OnActivation/the 0x3003 query never
> fire (INJECT_AREA_ACK correct+ready but premature). ⇒ **LIKELY ROOT: the SYNTHETIC SkMgrLogin (INJECT_SK_FLOW) is
> INCOMPLETE** — it lacks the real Guppy client's reply-to queue + pid/tid, so skmgr's RegisterConnection/ProcessExists
> validates pid -1 → loops. (This is NOT the winmgr render-thread; winmgr is up + serving. SYSFIRE render-autofire is
> a DEAD LEVER — it slowed the run so badly it didn't finish in 240s; the clean no-SYSFIRE baseline is correct.)
> **NEXT levers (concrete):** (a) give the injected SkMgrLogin a VALID reply-to queue + client pid/tid (the real
> Guppy softkey task id, available in-emulator) so skmgr's client-validation succeeds → OnSetMenu returns → skmgr
> reads the Activate → OnActivation → 0x3003 → INJECT_AREA_ACK → draw; (b) decompile skmgr's OnLogin/OnSetMenu

> ★★★★★ SOFTKEY LOGIN COMPLETES with winmgr's VALID PIDS (2026-06-27, cont.) — the spin was a REGRESSION from my own
> P_ident fix; reconciled. The "6-layer FModule synchronous-port GData-atomic spin" framing below is SUPERSEDED:

> screenshot 3→**118 colours**) — but breaks winmgr (P_ident=-1 → ProcessExists rejects WM clients). ROOT CAUSE:
> the P_ident-self fix (0e6a084, needed so winmgr accepts WM clients) split the softkey reply path into DISTINCT
> per-task queues — the SkMgrLogin reply-to is the FModule I/O thread's sync queue **Rts<ioTask>** (e.g. Rts108)
> while the softkey API CALLER reads its OWN **notify-bearing Client<callerTask>** (e.g. **Client107, notify
> 0x02000000**) on a DIFFERENT task. The old notify-gate (bed94e5) only redirected to the SAME-suffix Client
> (Client108, PASSIVE) → the 36B SkMgrLoginQuit stranded → the FModule sync-port poll spun forever. In the -1
> collapse ALL per-task queues fold to one notify-bearing "...ffffffff" queue, so the suffix match worked — that's
> why PIDENT_SELF=0 completes. **FIX = `HEROSCALL_SK_REPLY_FORCE`** (commit 3f4c4fc, default ON in
> run_3proc_skmgr_guppy.sh): when the suffix-matched Client is absent/passive, route the softkey-family
> (type-id>>16==0x28a) reply to **THE notify-bearing softkey Client queue** (notify_bits & 0x02000000) regardless
> of suffix. **VERIFIED with VALID pids** (winmgr-compatible, 3-proc INJECT_WMGR_ACK=1): softkey login completes
> identically to PIDENT_SELF=0 — serve **405**, **402** InfoResponses all redirected to **Client107(0x31e)**, **19
> .bmx** loaded, screenshot **118 colours**, crash 0. ⇒ the softkey CONTENT path is SOLVED for the winmgr-
> compatible valid-pid topology; the spin was never a GData mystery, just a reply landing on a passive queue.
> ★ REMAINING gate = the winmgr WINDOW (unchanged from the 4-proc brief): with WINMGR=1 INJECT_WMGR_ACK=0
> (the STABLE config — Guppy survives 4573 lines, crash 0), winmgr SERVES Q_WMGR (0x30e, replies 208B GetScreens
> to Guppy's 0x31e + skmgr's 0x313) but is stuck in its render-thread loop (`Q_read 0x30e → Ev_send(self,
> 0x04000000) → Ev_receive(0x05011001)`) and never runs **WmModule::Initialize → 0 XCreateWindow** → no
> VSoftKeyArea window → skmgr PutImage 0, InfoResponse 0 (login can't finish without the window). INJECT_WMGR_ACK=1
> DOES make winmgr create its 5 windows but now reliably CRASHES Guppy (2/2, the duplicate-reply WmRecvReplyEx
> serial-gap conflict). ⇒ the bar is gated SOLELY on winmgr's render-thread GUI handshake (the documented
> /dev/events event→fd render-tick frontier, INJECT_WMGR_ACK=0) so it runs WmModule::Initialize → creates +
> serves skmgr the REAL VSoftKeyArea window → skmgr draws the 19 loaded .bmx. The softkey half is done; this is
> the last layer. Run: `PIDENT_SELF=1 SK_REPLY_FORCE=1 WINMGR=1 INJECT_WMGR_ACK=0 bash run_3proc_skmgr_guppy.sh`.

> ★★★★ THE SPIN RE'd THROUGH 6 LAYERS (2026-06-27, cont.) — the gate is the FModule SYNCHRONOUS-PORT poll, NOT a
> plain queue read. Decompiled the full softkey-login receive chain (idalib across libSkMgrCtrl/libNcCtrlModule/
> libbackend): `GUPPYSKMGR_::Connect@0xbc9a0` → `SkMgrCtrlInterfaceImpl::LogIn@0xc130` (sends SkMgrLogin
> 0x28A0100/seq) → **`WaitForExpectedMessage@0xb7e0` = a BUSY-POLL** `while(1){m=WaitForNextMessage(); if(m &&
> IsA(m,0x28A0100) && m.seq==expected) break;}` (no blocking wait → the SIGBUS busy-loop) → `NcCtrlModule::
> WaitForNextMessage@0x8a80` (asserts a "synchronous port" this+41, then) → **`FModule::PollInput@0x23940`** =
> `(*(*(*(this+72)+4*idx)+40))(this)` → the input-port waitable's vtable+40 poll. On 0x28A0140 (SkMgrLoginQuit)
> it sets this+14=handle(body+56)+`RegisterConnection`; on 0x28A01E0 it `FindGData(118620288)`+`GDataHdlBase<Gd
> SkMgrCtrlServerResponse>::Connect`. ⇒ THE PRECISE GATE: the reply is received via the FModule **synchronous-
> port waitable poll** (PollInput → vtable+40), whose readiness is a GData/shared-mem atomic (the BUS_ADRALN
> spin) that the emulator's queue-notify (ev_send event word) does NOT satisfy — so even though skmgr's 36B
> SkMgrLoginQuit sits in the Rts10a sync queue (0x321), the sync-port poll never reports ready → the busy-loop
> never picks it up. (Normal FModule queue serves work via the event-word notify; the softkey SYNCHRONOUS port
> uses a different GData-atomic readiness.) NEXT (two faithful options): (1) disassemble the input-port waitable's

> ## ★ STRATEGIC FOCUS (2026-06-22, user-set) — TRACK B ONLY, ARM64-NATIVE
> The **sole** focus is **Track B: run the i386 control natively on Apple Silicon (ARM64) under
> FEX-Emu + the LD_PRELOAD heroscall emulator, and reach the real Qt MMI (`HrMmi.elf`) shown as a
> window on the Mac** — via the ~40 HeROS services → the ~92-process constellation. **Do NOT pursue
> Option A** (run the x86-64 guest in a hypervisor / VirtualBox / the Windows host-suite path): it is
> **already done** (docs 11 / README) and re-proving it (e.g. on the `yeen` x86-64 box) does nothing
> for the Apple-Silicon goal. The "Option A / x86_64" section below and `scripts/setup_vm_yeen.sh` are
> **kept for reference but DEPRIORITIZED**; the handwheel (19035) + JHIO (19009) protocol RE in them is
> track-agnostic and still useful. If a request seems to point back at x86-64/Option A, flag it first.

Goal: run HEIDENHAIN's **TNC640 programming station** (PGM-Platz Virtual, all-i386 control)
on **Apple-Silicon ARM64** — **NATIVELY via FEX + the heroscall emulator (Track B)**, to the real
Qt MMI. (x86-64 Linux under VirtualBox = already done, NOT the focus.) Background + measured findings:
`docs/` (start with `02-architecture.md`, `15-apple-silicon.md`, `16-arm64-decompilation-and-translation.md`).

Working environment (Apple Silicon M2 Max):
- ARM64 Linux VM: lima instance **`tnc`** (Ubuntu 26.04, vz). `limactl shell tnc -- <cmd>`.
- Host tools: Ghidra 12.1.2 + openjdk@21 (headless decompile), rizin, patchelf, lima.
- VM tools: qemu-user (`qemu-i386`), `gcc-i686-linux-gnu` cross-compiler, native `gcc`.
- Control extracted to `work/control/sysroot/` (binaries) + `work/target/rootfs/` (HeROS OS).
  Combined i386 sysroot for running: `work/target/rootfs` with `/heros5` grafted in.
- Decompiler pipeline: `work/re/scripts/DecompileToFile.java` + `batch_decompile.sh`.

> **NOTE — this tracker was consolidated for migration to an x86_64 host** (2026-06-21). The two
> auto-memory files that previously held the background below do NOT travel with the git clone, so
> their full content is inlined here (sections "Product architecture & background" and
> "Migration notes: moving the RE work to x86_64"). Everything needed to resume is in this file +
> `docs/` + `work/` + `recomp/`.

## Product architecture & background (HEIDENHAIN TNC640 PGM-Platz Virtual)

**Identity:** HEIDENHAIN **TNC640 Programming Station** (PGM-Platz Virtual), NC ident **340595**,
version **18 SP4**, extracted from the official download `34059518SP4/`. The shipped product is a
**Windows-native** package; goal of this repo is to run it on UNIX/macOS (and now ARM64). The user
already booted the bare `.vmdk` in a Linux VM but lacked the on-screen "steering panel".

**Architecture (as shipped on Windows):**
- Hypervisor: bundled **VirtualBox 7.1.4** (Win) runs the **HeROS5** guest (HEIDENHAIN Realtime OS,
  Yocto-based **x86_64** Linux, v5.18.04.002). VMware (VIX) is an alternative the installer accepts.
- Base VM = `base/TNCvbProg.ova` (OVF + 49 GB streamOptimized vmdk; partitions: **HEROS5** root,
  **BOOT**, **SYS**, **PLC**, **TNC**). On the base image SYS/PLC/TNC are EMPTY — the actual NC
  software (NCK/PLC/MMI) is flashed from `prog/setup.zip` (`target.tar.xz` 657 MB + SYS/PLC/TNC
  zips + RPMs) into those partitions on first install via the `Install` shared folder + HeROS
  `jhupdate`.
- **Host↔guest bridge** = (a) VirtualBox **shared folders** `Install`, `IOsim`, `PLC`, `TNC` mapped
  under the per-VM host folder; (b) VirtualBox **guest properties** `/HEIDENHAIN/*` (VMUSER/PW,
  CMD/Cmd, LC_ALL, CFG/Display/*); guest detects VBox via PCI `80eecafe` and loads
  vboxguest/vboxvideo/vboxsf in `/etc/init.d/virtualbox`.
- **Host control suite** (Qt6, in base MSI under `HEIDENHAIN\TNCvbBase\control\`):
  - `tncvbcntl.exe` (= `JHCNTLEXE`, the launcher: imports/creates VM, starts it as a **fullscreen
    native VirtualBox VM window** via `GUI/*` extradata, spawns the others),
  - **`keypad.exe`** (on-screen TNC keyboard / soft-key panel = the missing "steering panel"; feeds
    guest `heuinput` synthetic-input daemon via FIFO `/tmp/__heuinput`),
  - `handwheel.exe` (jog wheel, **QTcpSocket to guest port 19035**),
  - `jhiosimhostd.exe` + `iosim.dll` (= JHIOsim) + `plcmap.dll` (machine **PLC I/O simulation**).
- **JHIO extpack** `Heidenhain_VBoxJHIO_Extension_Pack-4.3.0-r6.vbox-extpack` = VBox HGCM host
  service `VBoxJHIO` (Win-only DLLs); bridges guest PLC I/O to host `iosim.dll` via a memory-mapped
  file in the `IOsim` shared folder, synced per PLC scan cycle. **Only host piece with no
  cross-platform binary.**
- Licensing: **SIK** options (`hegetsikopt`/`helicenseviewer`), USB dongles **MARX CrypToken**
  (VID 0d7a) + **AKS Hardlock** (VID 0529), and TE 5xx/6xx/7xx keyboard units (VID 1091) — all
  USB-passthrough device filters in the OVF. Without license → demo mode.

**Original porting blockers (Windows→UNIX):** x86_64 guest on Apple Silicon needs slow QEMU/UTM
emulation (VBox-ARM can't run x86 guests); the Windows Qt control suite + Win-only JHIO extpack must
be replaced/reimplemented or run via a Linux x86 VBox host. The reimplementation surface is: the Qt
apps + small iosim/plcmap DLLs + the documented **port 19035** / **heuinput FIFO** / shared-folder +
guestproperty protocol. (This is the "option A" path; the current focus below is "option B" =
translate/run the i386 control directly.)

**Workspace / extraction provenance:**
- Extracted artifacts live in `work/`: `ova/`, `extpack/`, `msi_prog/`, `msi_base/` (APPDIR:./control),
  `setupmeta/`. Raw disk = `work/ova/disk.raw` (sparse), inspected read-only via
  `hdiutil attach -nomount` (slices /dev/disk4s1..s7) + `debugfs` (brew e2fsprogs) — no mounting.
- **Control binaries are NOT in `target.tar.xz`** (that's just the HeROS OS). They live in
  `prog/setup.zip` → `TNC640_SYS.{1,2,3}.zip` → tree rooted at `heros5/bin/`. Extracted to
  `work/control/sysroot/`; HeROS OS to `work/target/rootfs/`.
- Host tools installed during this work: sevenzip, cabextract, binwalk, qemu, e2fsprogs, msitools,
  Ghidra 12.1.2 + openjdk@21, rizin 0.8.2, patchelf, lima 2.1.3.

## Recompiled to native ARM64 + BEHAVIORALLY verified (`recomp/`) — 13 libraries, 112 functions
The classes that the byte-identical bar EXCLUDES (computed FP/libm, C++ class methods with `this`,
pointer indirection) reimplemented natively and proven **observably equivalent**: identical
outputs for identical inputs, exact for ints/bools, doubles within a tight FP tolerance — measured
diff vs the genuine i386 `.so` under qemu-i386. (NOT same SHA-256; the `.text` genuinely differs.)

### Behavioral method (how it differs from byte-identical)
Verification standard relaxes from "same SHA-256" to "same observable outputs": exact for
integer/boolean returns, FP tolerance (ULP/relative + a near-zero absolute floor) for computed
doubles. Two key techniques: (1) **per-arch-native objects** — for `this`/pointer-chasing C++
methods, the harness mirrors the class FIELD ORDER and builds the object per-arch from identical
LOGICAL inputs (i386 reproduces 4-byte-ptr offsets, ARM uses 8-byte), so the same harness drives
both sides past the "32-bit stored ptr can't address 64-bit buffer" wall. (2) **bool low-byte
contract** — i386 `bool` returns only define `al`; the upper eax bytes (CONCAT31/setb leak,
load-address-dependent) are read off by declaring the harness prototype `_Bool`. Same oracle recipe
(trim NEEDED, soname/version stub, neuter ctors) as the byte-identical set.

## Method refinements (this session) — the oracle recipe generalised
For C++ libs whose leaf functions are libc-only but whose `.so` drags the HeROS runtime:
1. **trim** heavy `DT_NEEDED` (patchelf `--remove-needed`), keep libstdc++/libm/libgcc_s/libc;
2. **stub** the residual non-glibc imports with an auto-generated `.so` (symbols the leaves never
   touch) — when a `HEROSLIB_500.0`/`JHVOLUMELIB_500.0`/`Qt_5`/… VERNEED remains, give the stub that
   library's **soname** + a version script so the load-time version check passes. For libs whose
   surviving VERNEED spans **several** sonames (e.g. Qt: `Qt_5` from Svg/Gui/Core/Quick), `recomp/bmx/
   gen_oracle.py` emits one stub per file, each defining every version it's listed for;
3. **neuter** the C++ static ctors/dtors (`recomp/*/neuter_init.py` zeroes DT_INIT/FINI[_ARRAY]) —
   leaf functions need no global init, and the ctors would call into the trimmed-away runtime.
The recompiled `.text` of each verified function is the genuine proprietary machine code, unchanged.
Gotchas: do all patchelf NEEDED edits in ONE invocation (repeated calls corrupt larger `.so` →
"section past EOF", rejected by ld.bfd); a candidate must be EXPORTED in `.dynsym` to be the oracle.

## Candidate next decompile/recompile targets — MORE LEAVES REMAIN (set NOT exhausted)
- Still-unharvested: more `libEp90_Gtlib` single-field classifiers (IsGewinde-style, ~40 candidates),
  `libplckernel` integer accessors, `libProductId`/`libspi`/`libStartUpCtrl` (already decompiled),
  un-scanned libs (`libplcbin` siblings, `libEp90_Aeplib/Errplib/…`). NOTE: confirm a candidate is
  EXPORTED in `.dynsym` before building — local symbols (e.g. `hexbyte`, `FlModAccess`) aren't
  dynamically linkable, so they can't be the truth oracle even though their machine code is genuine.
- Excluded by the byte-identical bar: **C++ class methods** (libtncMetaValue, libProductId — vtables/`this`),
  **multi-level pointer chasers** (Gtlib/Dm list walkers — 32-bit stored pointers can't address a
  64-bit buffer), and **computed FP / libm** (Ep90 geometry, `dmathe_*` — x87-vs-SSE / double-rounding).
- Recompile generalises to PURE LEAF code only (no C++ classes/state, no FP boundary) — see doc 16 §3/§3a.

## OPTION A (TRACK A) — ⚠️ DEPRIORITIZED (already done; NOT the focus — see STRATEGIC FOCUS banner at top)
> Kept for reference + the track-agnostic handwheel/JHIO protocol RE. The x86-64 hypervisor path is
> complete (docs 11) and is **not** pursued further; the focus is Track B (ARM64-native, below).
Option A = run the **stock x86-64 HeROS5 guest** in a hypervisor (VirtualBox on an x86-64 Linux
host; the real NC SW boots natively → NO i386 translation, NO config #6, the SIK/productid come
from the real flashed install/demo) and reimplement the **Windows Qt host control suite** natively
for UNIX/macOS. This is the more promising path to a *fully usable* control. State (docs 05/06/08/
11/12/14, `keypad/`, `handwheel/`, `scripts/setup_vm.sh`, `tnc640`):
- **DONE:** x86-64 Linux boots the control to the live MMI (demo mode, headless, VBox — doc 11);
  native **launcher** (`tnc640`+`setup_vm.sh` = VBoxManage import/sharedfolders/guestprops/startvm);
  native **keypad** (`keypad/`, PySide6, both layouts, full keymap, validated live via VBox
  `putScancodes` — doc 12).
- **★★ 2026-06-22 — BOTH remaining host-suite protocols REVERSE-ENGINEERED (doc 18):** the guest's
  own portscan whitelist (`etc/sysconfig/portscan-whitelist.cfg`) names the listeners.
  1. **Handwheel = TCP 19035, served by the NCK `ipo.elf`** (`HRSimServer.cpp`), NOT a separate
     daemon. Decompiled `HrSimThread@0x54adb0` (Ghidra, `work/re/out/ipo_HRSimServer.decomp.c`):
     **input frame = 33 bytes (`0x21`) = 8×int32 LE + 1 byte**; frame[0]=per-connection id the
     server validates; the rest carry jog-delta/axis/2 overrides/key-bitmap (exact via
     `HrSim410GetInput` = jog+keys, `HrSim520GetInput` = jog+2 ov+wider keys). Server polls an
     eventfd + ≤5 clients; output = LED bitmap + HR520/550 `HRDISPLAYDATA` (4×20 + cursor + enable)
     written per PLC cycle. Client `handwheel.exe` = Qt6/QML over QDataStream/QTcpSocket (server is
     authoritative). Native codec: **`handwheel/hrproto.py`** (33-byte frame encode/decode +
     self-test, the analogue of `keypad/tnckeymap.py`). OPEN (needs a LIVE capture, not doable on
     the Mac — needs the running x86-64 guest): the connect handshake seeding `id` + the exact
     f1..f8→{jog,axis,ov,keys} order. GUI = TODO (after live validation).
  2. **★★★ JHIO PLC-I/O has a CROSS-PLATFORM NETWORK TRANSPORT — reframes the "deepest blocker".**
     The docs (05/06/08) called JHIO Windows-only (the `VBoxJHIO` HGCM extpack + `iosim.dll`). But
     the guest ships **`usr/lib/libjhiosimnet.so.1.0`** (linked by **`plc.elf`**) exposing the SAME
     `_JHIOIntern*` block API over **TCP 19009**. `applaunch:set_jhiosim_env` sets
     `JHIOSIM_GUEST_IF=<ethN>` + `JHIOSIM_SVR_PORT=19009` → **guest is the TCP server** on the
     machine-net iface; a host I/O-sim connects as **client** (`JHIOSIM_MODE=1`, `JHIOSIM_SVR_IP`,
     `JHIOSIM_SVR_PORT`). Decompiled (`work/re/out/libjhiosimnet.decomp.c`): per PLC cycle **send
     740-byte (`0x2e4`) `JHIO_HEADER`** (djb2-hashed; version field@+8 = 100..400 = v1.0..4.0),
     **exchange the I/O block** (`PutBlocks` diffs + change-hash; data at `lDataOffset`/`lDataSize`),
     **recv host inputs**, lockstep via `SignalPlcCycleDone`/`WaitForSimCycleDone`. Full
     `JHIO_HEADER` machine-I/O map decoded from `print_JHIO_HEADER` (Inputs/Outputs/BWDs/ADC-DAC per
     terminal X45/X48/X148/X8_9/X150/X151/PL410/PL510/MOP/ES/X12/X13, SPLC safety I/O,
     `lControlIsReady`, `lvirtualTNCLicense`, …) — see doc 18 §1.4. So a host I/O-sim is a TCP
     client speaking a now-documented protocol, NOT a Windows wall (still needs a machine I/O model
     = `iosim.dll`/`plcmap.dll` behaviour; demo programming may tolerate a minimal "ready/no-fault").
- **Tooling note (this session):** Ghidra headless default heap is **2G** → OOM on the 8.2 MB
  `ipo_progstation.elf`; override with `GHIDRA_HEADLESS_MAXMEM=20G`. Name-filtered post-script
  `work/re/scripts/DecompileFiltered.java` (env `GHIDRA_DECOMP_FILTER`) decompiles only a function
  cluster from a huge binary; runner `work/re/scripts/decompile_optionA.sh`. `analyzeHeadless`
  requires the project dir to pre-exist.
- **★★★★ LIVE on a real x86-64 host (`ssh yeen` = styx, Arch + KVM + VirtualBox 7.2.10, 2026-06-22).**
  Ran the WHOLE Option-A path end-to-end, automated: scp the proprietary OVA(410M)+setup.zip(1.1G) to
  yeen, `scripts/setup_vm_yeen.sh` (import OVA + NAT port-forwards 19035/19009/5900/2222 + shared
  folders + stage setup.zip), headless boot. **The real TNC 640 control BOOTS to the live MMI in demo
  mode** (installer ran: Extract archive→RPM→Replace→Finalize→reboot→MMI; Shareware "max 100 NC lines"
  + OEM-password notice — reproduces doc 11 on a fresh box). Live validations:
  • **Keypad (shipped) VALIDATED live:** `keyboardputscancode 3b bb`(F1)+`5b db`(CE) dismissed the
    Shareware dialog → **Programming mode** ("Power interrupted", control-voltage-OFF). This IS the
    native keypad's putScancodes transport.
  • **Handwheel server (19035) VALIDATED:** `InitServerSocket` binds `0x5b4a0002`=AF_INET:0x4a5b(19035)
    listen(5); server SILENT on connect (matches decompile); **accepts the 33-byte frame** (id=0 BSS
    default accepted, connection held). Full jog-motion needs an operating mode (control-ready) ⇒
    handwheel & JHIO are COUPLED. `handwheel/hr_probe.py`.
  • **★ JHIO (19009) — protocol model CORRECTED by the live control: it's a TCP RPC, not a passive
    header push.** Even booted with `/HEIDENHAIN/IOSIM/Network=on`, 19009 is an active listener that
    returns nothing to a passive recv and closes a raw 740B push — it **waits for an RPC request**.
    Decompiled `send_request`/`read_response`/`fcn_id_to_str`: **20-byte request** (cFcnId@+4, parm1/2/3
    @+8/+c/+10) / **16-byte response** (cFcnId@+4, rc@+8, val@+c); **cFcnId opcodes 10..26** (jump table
    .data 0x1ad2c, one per _JHIOIntern* call); the 740B JHIO_HEADER + lDataSize block ride as bulk
    transfers on GetHeader/GetBlock/PutBlock; cycle lockstep via Signal/WaitForSimCycleDone. doc 18 §1.3/§3
    updated; `jhio/jhioproto.py` gains pack_request/unpack_response. Remaining for a working host I/O-sim:
    the exact opcode↔name map (jump-table disasm) + the per-cycle client + a machine I/O model.
  • **cFcnId opcode map RECOVERED** (from `fcn_id_to_str`): INTERN_INIT 0x0a, SET_PLC_RUN_MODE 0x0b,
    GET_HEADER 0x0c, GET_BLOCK 0x0d, PUT_BLOCK 0x0e, GET_BASE_OFFSET 0x0f, IS_SIM_RUNNING 0x11,
    SET_CTRL_READY 0x12, GET_SIM_ID 0x13, WAIT_SIM_CYCLE_DONE 0x14, SIG_PLC_CYCLE_DONE 0x15,
    GET_DATASIZE 0x18, GET_HEADERSIZE 0x19, CLEAR_PUTBLOCKS 0x1a. Request magic = `"JHIO"`(0x4f49484a).
  • **Live RPC probe (128 tries) NEVER answered** — the guest's per-connection handler (`accept_client`
    → callback → close) does NOT reply to an unsolicited GET_* from a passive client. So the live
    exchange needs the correct **host-side role** (host = the I/O peer the PLC drives, + session/cycle
    handshake) = a real host I/O-sim, not a passive requester.
  • **★ Operational finding:** `IOSIM/Network=on` but NO host I/O-sim peer ⇒ the control **cleanly
    powers off ~3 min after boot** (PLC requires its net I/O peer; VBox.log clean PoweredOff, no crash).
    `IOSIM/Network=off` ⇒ control **stable** in demo/Programming mode (programming station works; no
    19009 server). Stable config = network-off.
- **NEXT (Track A):** build the host I/O-sim = the guest's network I/O PEER (answer the guest's RPC
  in the right role: serve GET_BLOCK / accept PUT_BLOCK, GetHeader → the live machine-I/O map, drive
  SIG/WAIT cycle handshake, assert SET_CTRL_READY) — this both keeps the control up under network mode
  AND unlocks the operating modes + the handwheel jog-motion end-to-end; then a native handwheel GUI.
  Recovery: VM `TNC640` on yeen is installed+flashed (no reinstall) — `VBoxManage startvm TNC640
  --type headless`; ack Shareware `keyboardputscancode 3b bb`; **keep IOSIM/Network OFF for a stable
  programming station**. vmusr pw is in guestproperty but guest sshd is publickey-only. Stop:
  `VBoxManage controlvm TNC640 poweroff`. Screenshots: `VBoxManage controlvm TNC640 screenshotpng`.

## TRANSLATION PORT ROADMAP (current focus — option B: run unmodified i386 control on native ARM64)

Status: i386 userspace translation **works** on the M2 (NCK interpolator loads its full 100-lib
closure and runs its own init). First hard blocker = the **HeROS kernel API**.

### Phase 1 — Understand the `heroscall` kernel ABI  ✓ DONE
- [x] 1.1 `222` = heros.ko custom gateway (unassigned in mainline i386); `407` = `clock_nanosleep_time64` (real, qemu-i386 lacks it — secondary)
- [x] 1.2 heroscall is issued via libc **`syscall()`** → **LD_PRELOAD emulation is viable, no qemu patch needed.** Probe: `work/re/shim/heroscall_probe.c`
- [x] 1.3 `heros.ko` `sym.heros_entry` is a **pSOS-style RTOS dispatcher**. ABI: `syscall(222, cmd, param_ptr, arg)`, `cmd = 0x1234_NNNN`. Full command map decompiled → `work/re/out/heros_ko.decomp.c`:
  `01 T_ident · 02 T_start · 09 T_name · 0a Q_create · 0d Q_send · 0e Q_read · 10 Ev_send · 11 Ev_receive · 15 Sm_create · 18 Sm_request · 27 Sys_getenv · …`
- [x] 1.4 Init's actual queries captured (the shim runs in-process, derefs the arg ptr):
  - `Sys_getenv` names: **SYS, SYS_NAME, USR, USR_NAME, OEM, OEM_NAME, OEME, OEME_NAME, EXECDIR, EXECDIRH, EXECBAT** (partition/identity/exec paths)
  - `T_ident` name=0 (ident self) → needs a valid task id; plus `Sm_create`/`Q_create`/`T_name` handle setup

### Phase 2 — Build the LD_PRELOAD heroscall emulator  ✓ DONE (passes blockers #1–#4)
Built natively on the x86_64 box (no qemu). Sources in **`emulator/`**, full write-up in
**`docs/17-heroscall-emulator.md`**. The NCK now boots through its whole RTOS/kernel-API init.
- [x] 2.1 Skeleton: interpose `syscall()`, dispatch `cmd & 0xff`, pass non-222 to raw `int 0x80`.
- [x] 2.2 `Sys_getenv` — values recovered VERBATIM from the control's own boot scripts
  (`heros5/bin/../application` + `appproduct`): `SYS=/mnt/sys OEM=/mnt/plc USR=/mnt/tnc
  OEME=/mnt/plce EXECDIRH=/mnt/sys/heros5/bin EXECBAT=/mnt/sys/batch/heros5 SYS_NAME=SYSTEM:
  OEM_NAME=PLC: OEME_NAME=PLCE: USR_NAME=TNC:`. Served via `getenv()` from `run_nck.sh`.
- [x] 2.3 `T_ident(self)`→nonzero tid; `Sm/Q/M_create`→fake handles; **`M_ident`→nonzero region id,
  `M_attach`→a real 64 MB zeroed `mmap`** (this is what clears PciHardware).
- [x] 2.4 Past `PciHardware::Exception` ✓. Then past `FProcess` argv assert (#3) with
  `-p=~/IPO IPO -k=NC -M` (argv recovered from `batch/TNC640heros.txt`), then past IPO option
  parsing → reached blocker **#5 = the configuration subsystem**.

### Phase 3 — Iterate the blocker chain to a running control  ← NEXT
Blocker #5 is the first **application-level**, inherently **multi-process** dependency:
`CfgMailslot::GetData` (libbackend-server.so) is a CLIENT of a config **server** over a HeROS
mailslot queue (`CfgMailslotQueue::CreateQueue`+`GetData`). IPO standalone has no server → the
"NC" channel-group lookup returns err 42 → IPO aborts (misleading "Invalid Command Option -k").
- [ ] 3.1 Upgrade the emulator's RTOS primitives from in-process fakes to **real cross-process IPC**
  (SysV shm/sem/msg keyed by the HeROS names) so forked peers share one namespace.
- [ ] 3.2 Run `AppStartMP.elf` (the process manager) so it spawns the constellation
  (IPO + PLC + config server + Geo + …) which then answer each other's config/queue requests.
- [ ] 3.3 Then: message bus (`libGMessage*`), FUSE backends, device nodes, X/Qt MMI. Full boot to
  the Qt MMI remains the documented frontier.

### Known blockers (live)
- **#1 `/dev/herosapi` open** — PASSED (`emulator/herosapi_shim.c`).
- **#2 `heroscall` syscall 222 / `PciHardware::Exception`** — PASSED. `M_ident("IPO_SHARED_MEMORY")`
  + `M_attach` now serve a real zeroed region (`emulator/heroscall_emu.c`).
- **#3 `FProcess` argv assert** — PASSED (correct argv).  **#4 empty `Sys_getenv`** — PASSED (real env).
- **#5 config subsystem / IPO connect-ACK** — ★ **SOLVED 2026-06-22 (commits 92a98c5/6108aef): IPO
  CONNECTS.** ConfigServer's `SendConnected` can NEVER flush IPO — clients are inserted into the client
  Rb_tree only in `CfgServer::Initialize@0x187b4a`, never in `OnConnectClient` (which only `_Rb_tree::find`s),
  so IPO is never registered (the SIK/Hws-stub "run-up" story was a layer below this). The fix bypasses
  ConfigServer: **`HEROSCALL_INJECT_ACK`** synthesizes IPO's `CfgClientIsConnected`(id **0x170100**;
  fields clientId/id/success; **success=OK**; schema decoded from `.rodata 0x230b80/0x230bc0`) and posts it
  straight to IPO's reply queue. IPO reads it, prints **"Connected"**, and proceeds (`OnCfgClientIsConnected
  @0x1a72d0` → `CfgMailslotQueue::Create` → `SyncMessage` → `AskIpoConditions`). Also proven en route:
  synthetic **`UpdNewState`** (id 0x1f0320) deserializes + drives `OnUpdNewState` — the GMessage deserializer
  is **schema-driven**, so messages are built from the `.rodata` schema templates (gated `INJECT_UPD`).
  Run-up fixes retained (SIK/Hws stub, `Ev_receive`, `MAXQ`). See docs/17 §Update(2026-06-22).
- **#6 ★★★★★ SOLVED (2026-06-24) — config #6 was the `%SYS%`/`%OEM%` MACRO NON-EXPANSION, NOT the
  constellation.** All the "needs the constellation per-client/layer state" analysis below is SUPERSEDED.
  Found via IDA Hex-Rays (MCP + idalib headless) + a Mac-side LD_PRELOAD logging interposer (`emulator/cfgprobe.c`)
  on the FEX standalone ConfigServer (libConfigSystem is NOT -Bsymbolic → its exported intra-lib calls are
  GOT-routed + interposable). Chain: `CfgServer::Start → ReadConfigDataSet (UNCONDITIONAL) → ReadConfigDataDir
  → ReadDir → ReadOneMsg`. The CfgJhConfigDataFiles message PARSES fine and is NOT forbidden, but because
  `IsSysFile` is FALSE, `CfgServer::IsJhEntity@0x20bce0` REJECTS it (0x1400010, nulls *msg); ReadDir only
  entity-matches when ReadOneMsg returns 0, so the nonzero return → message discarded → ReadDir 0 →
  `MissingFile` → ReadConfigDataDir 0 → no OEM index → IPO -k=NC. `ServerHelper::IsSysFile`/`IsOemFile` are
  FALSE because they do `IsAncestorOf(FSystemPathname::sys()/oem(), filePath)` and `sys()/oem() =
  FSystemPathname::Convert("%SYS%/" / "%OEM%/")` returns the **UNEXPANDED literal** "%SYS%/" standalone (the
  %-macro table is empty; Convert does path-format conversion only) → ancestor check fails vs the resolved
  "/mnt/sys/config/...". (The earlier sessions SAW the `%SYS%/%OEM%` literals failing on the FS but wrongly
  dismissed them as a layout/version "side issue" — they are the CORE gate.) FIX = `emulator/cfgfix.c`
  (LD_PRELOAD): classify IsSysFile/IsOemFile by the real resolved prefix (/mnt/sys/* IS a SYS file, /mnt/plc/*
  IS an OEM file — exactly what the macro would expand to). VERIFIED under FEX (`FIX=1`/cfgfix.so): **ReadConfig
  DataDir 0 → 24 (SUCCESS)**; the load CASCADES — 20+ data files OPENED incl. configfiles.cfg (OEM index),
  **channel.cfg (the NC channel)**, tnc.cfg, ChannelCfg.atr, GlobalSystemCfg.atr, axlist.cfg, kin.cfg. Tooling:
  IDA 9.4 GUI+MCP, idalib headless (scratchpad/idalibvenv + idadecompile.py), cfgprobe.c, cfgfix.c; run recipes
  `scratchpad/cfgresolve3.sh` (FIX=1) + `scratchpad/run_2proc_cfgfix.sh` (ConfigServer+cfgfix+IPO). NEXT: confirm
  IPO passes -k=NC in the 2-proc, then bring up the constellation under FEX with cfgfix → HrMmi. Original (now
  superseded) #6 notes follow:
- **#6 config-data round-trip (NEW frontier, past the connect)** — IPO reaches
  `IpoController/IpoKonfig::CheckOptions()` and fails `-k=NC` ("Invalid Command Option -k", AFTER "Connected").
  ROOT CAUSE FOUND: **ConfigServer's channel-group DB is empty** — it reads the config INDEX
  (`jhconfigfiles.cfg`, direct `-f=` path) but the listed files use **volume paths** (`SYS:\config\tnc.cfg`).
  Those resolve via the HeROS **volume manager** (`libjhvolume` → `/etc/jhvolume`), which was MISSING →
  the control spun retrying `open("/etc/jhvolume")=ENOENT` and never loaded `tnc.cfg` (which DOES define
  "NC"). `emulator/setup_jhvolume.sh` populates `/etc/jhvolume`. **Volume resolution FIXED**: register the
  names WITH the trailing colon (`jhvolume --set "SYS:" /tmp/s`, not `"SYS"`) — then `SYS:\config\tnc.cfg`
  resolves to `/tmp/s/config/tnc.cfg` (the colon form the control uses). STILL not sufficient: `strace`
  shows ConfigServer reads only the INDEX and **never opens `tnc.cfg`** even with resolution working, and
  fails on the runtime-generated productid cache (`/mnt/sys/cache/nckern/productid/*.conf`, ENOENT — uses
  a hardcoded `/mnt/sys`, not `$SYS`). So the remaining gap is the config-LOAD mechanism (productid gate /
  binary cache / a deferred "activate configuration" trigger the absent MMI/constellation sends), NOT the
  path layer. CONFIG-LOAD PATH FOUND: `ReadDataFiles@0x214540` (the file loader) ← `ReadConfigDataSet
  @0x229d50` ← `OnUpdNewState` (NOT `OnRereadData`, which is write-back/refresh). `HEROSCALL_INJECT_REREAD`
  posts a synthetic **UpdNewState** (id 0x1f0320) onto CfgServerQueue at run-up; verified ConfigServer
  reads it, runs `OnUpdNewState` (`Q_ident "Nc"`), and `ReadConfigDataSet` FIRES — broadcasting real config
  to QEvtServer (a 4380-byte payload + 664/608/550/539B…). So the load path EXECUTES. BUT `tnc.cfg` is
  still never opened and IPO still fails — `ReadDataFiles` runs yet skips the channel-group file. Remaining
  gate is INSIDE `ReadDataFiles`. Chain fully RE'd: jhconfigfiles.cfg IS read+parsed (strace: read=2736B
  `CfgJhConfigDataFiles(...jhDataFiles:=[...]`); `ReadConfigDataSet`→`ReadConfigDataDir@0x2150a0`→
  `SetupDirInfo@0x2a2a60` (registers via `CfgStore::DataFile`) + `ReadDataFiles`→loop `CntDataFiles`×
  `PrepareFile@0x20d9a0`(`FSystemPathname::IsAFile` exists-check→`ReadHeader`, else `MissingFile`). ★ ROOT
  CAUSE SURFACED: ConfigServer's stdout shows it expects the config at a HARDCODED **`/mnt/sys/config`** and
  **encfs-mounts an ENCRYPTED subdir** there: `encdir: Create directory failed ... /mnt/sys/config/jh_int` +
  `sh: encfs: not found` + `umount: /mnt/sys/config/jh_int`. So the config dir is an **encfs (encrypted
  filesystem) mount** the control sets up at startup — standalone it fails (encfs not installed; /mnt/sys→
  sysroot is READ-ONLY so encdir can't create jh_int; jh_int needs the OEM key). **IMPLEMENTED**
  `emulator/setup_config_env.sh` (install encfs 1.9.5 + writable `/mnt/sys/config` + colon-form volumes→
  `/mnt/sys`). RESULT: encfs is a RED HERRING — jh_int is OEM-secret storage and tnc.cfg is PLAINTEXT; the
  encdir mount still fails under qemu (FUSE/`unshare`) but non-fatally. ★ DECISIVE host-strace
  (`-e openat,newfstatat,statx,access`): ConfigServer NEVER opens OR STATS tnc.cfg or any data `.cfg/.atr`
  (0 touched). So `PrepareFile/IsAFile` is never reached ⇒ CfgStore per-layer registration is EMPTY
  (`CntDataFiles=0`) ⇒ `ReadDataFiles` skips every file. jhconfigfiles.cfg IS parsed (2736B) but
  `SetupDirInfo→CfgStore::DataFile` registers nothing for the layer; the 4380B config ConfigServer
  broadcasts comes from a CACHE (`/tmp/CBIOS_MAPPED_FILE_REV_200`), not the files. So the real gate is the
  per-layer data-file REGISTRATION. ★★ ABSOLUTE ROOT CAUSE (corrected — encfs is NOT a red herring): the
  config DATA dir IS an **encfs-encrypted mount**. ConfigServer reads config from `/mnt/sys/config/jh_int`
  (the encfs DECRYPTED view of the encrypted store `_jh_int`); strace shows it opens `jh_int`(O_DIRECTORY)
  + `jh_int/layout`, NEVER the plaintext `/mnt/sys/config/*.cfg`. `encDir` is a C++ class in libConfigSystem
  (encDir::start/stop/pathDecrypt) that at startup writes a FRESH `_jh_int/.encfs6.xml` (O_TRUNC) +
  `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` + encfs-mounts `jh_int`. TWO sub-gates: (1) **unshare needs root** — as my user it
  fails (`error unshare ret`/`error encfs`); ★ run ConfigServer as ROOT (sudo qemu-i386, `/dev/fuse`
  present) and the encDir errors VANISH, the mount succeeds (`encdir: mounted`). (2) **the encrypted store
  is EMPTY** — encDir makes a fresh encfs so `jh_int` is empty; my extraction has the PLAINTEXT config
  (tnc.cfg @ /mnt/sys/config) but NOT the encrypted `_jh_int` (built at install/flash time), and ConfigServer
  does NOT populate jh_int from plaintext → `jh_int` empty → `CntDataFiles=0` → tnc.cfg never read. The 4380B
  config it broadcasts is from a cache (`/tmp/CBIOS_MAPPED_FILE`), not the files. NEXT (the real install
  step): run ConfigServer as ROOT and make the encDir store contain the config — a config INSTALL that
  writes the plaintext config through ConfigServer into jh_int (CfgWriteData), or pre-encrypt it into
  `_jh_int` and stop the O_TRUNC re-init. FINAL: the store is **SIK-KEYED** — `encDir::start` ← 
  `ServerHelper::DecryptConfig@0x2a14b0`; crypto = `sik_encrypt`/`TEOS_DoEncryptRSA` (the SIK/license).
  `DecryptConfig` READS the already-encrypted config from jh_int (→ `CfgStore::HashObj`); it does NOT
  migrate plaintext. ★ CORRECTION (NOT license-barred): the encfs invocation is `echo
  "Yomxn8YJyvrbNli62Rpl" | encfs -S _jh_int jh_int` — the password is a FIXED, DETERMINISTIC string (not
  the dongle). encfs round-trips fine; the encryption is just data-at-rest with a known key. Clean test:
  ConfigServer creates an EMPTY encfs (0 files in _jh_int) and does NOT migrate the plaintext; the volume
  key is random per-create so pre-populating can't align. So the config must be written THROUGH ConfigServer
  via **`CfgWriteData`** (`CfgServer::OnWriteData@0x225510`) — the jhupdate/installer mechanism: it encrypts
  each entity into its current store, then serves it. NEXT (tractable, the real step): reimplement the
  config INSTALL — construct `CfgWriteData` for the config (minimally the "NC" channel group) and send it to
  ConfigServer running as ROOT (encDir's unshare needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN; /dev/fuse present). Substantial
  GMessage construction (like INJECT_ACK but the full config schema), but engineering — NOT a legal barrier.
  ★ 2nd CORRECTION: the encfs is a DETOUR. Decisive test (jh_int = PLAIN DIR with the 27 config files +
  no-op encfs): ConfigServer ENUMERATES it (`getdents64` on jh_int + descends into `jh_int/layout`) yet
  opens 0 data .cfg and IPO still fails -k=NC. So config presence+enumeration is NOT sufficient — the gate
  is the per-layer data-file REGISTRATION (`SetupDirInfo@0x2a2a60`→`CfgStore::DataFile`; `CntDataFiles=0`),
  INDEPENDENT of the encfs. ConfigServer reads `jh_int/layout/` (subdir-structured), so the data files are
  likely expected in a per-LAYER subdir structure and/or registration is gated on the absent productid
  cache (controlmark selects the layer/variant). NEXT (the actual gate): RE `SetupDirInfo`/`ReadConfigDataDir`
  for the layer/dir-structure + productid it needs to register the jhDataFiles. This is the registration
  subsystem — not the encfs, not licensing. `emulator/setup_config_env.sh` holds the env. ★★ ULTIMATE GATE:
  the registration is gated on the **productid** (control mark). `libProductId` reads
  `/mnt/sys/cache/nckern/productid/*.conf`; ConfigServer does `ProductId::GetControlMark()` +
  **`OptionLib::GetOptionTable(CfgControlMark, SikGeneration)`** — control-mark + **SIK** select the
  option/config table driving the layer. The productid cache is written by **`AppStartMP.elf`**, which —
  tried standalone — **hangs at "waiting for X-Server startup"**: it needs the full GUI boot. So blocker #6
  ultimately requires the FULL BOOT (AppStartMP + X to generate the productid) and the SIK (the option
  table). The
  full-system qemu path works because the productid was generated at boot + the SIK from the dongle/demo at
  flash. This is the current frontier of Track B (userspace emulation). (Connect, blocker #5, solid.)
  ★ UPDATE — productid is SYNTHESIZABLE without the full boot: `ProductId::Update`→`ProductInfo::Init@0x1600`
  reads the confs with C++ **ifstream** (`operator>>(int&)` for controlmark.conf→+0x90, `_M_extract<bool>` for
  the bool confs +0x94/+0x95/+0x96) — i.e. PLAIN ASCII (an int or 0/1 per file). Wrote them (controlmark=0,
  progstationversion=1, virtualmachine=1, …): ConfigServer now READS all 5 (no more ENOENT). BUT registration
  STILL 0 / IPO still fails: necessary-not-sufficient. Remaining gate = the control-mark VALUE (0 yields a
  wrong/empty `GetOptionTable` → wrong layer) and/or the per-LAYER DIR LAYOUT (ConfigServer descends into
  `jh_int/layout/`, so flat tnc.cfg isn't where `ConfigDataFile`/`DataStore::RetrieveLayer(LayerNr)` looks).
  So the productid is a DONE step; NEXT = the prog-station control-mark value + the per-layer config layout.
  ★★★ DECISIVE (runtime trace): the qemu-user load base is STABLE per-setup (0x40a16000), so traced
  `ReadConfigDataDir` with `-d in_asm -dfilter`. It runs `0x2150a0–0x215280` then JUMPS to `0x215504`,
  SKIPPING the registration loop (`ReplacePath@0x215325`/`ConfigDataFile`/`DataFile@0x215373` never execute)
  → `CntDataFiles=0`. The skip is `0x215283: test %al; je 0x215588` = **`CfgServer::ReadDir` returned FALSE**.
  ReadDir@0x214140 → `PathName(0,LayerNr)@0x243380` → `FSystemPathname::IsAFile()` → `0x21421e je .cold`.
  PathName → `DataStore::RetrieveLayer(LayerNr)@0x241db0` then reads layer +0x54(array)/+0x58(count). ⇒ THE
  GATE: the **DataStore layer is EMPTY/MISSING**, so `PathName(0)` is invalid → `IsAFile` false → ReadDir
  bails → the jhDataFiles loop is skipped — regardless of encfs/productid/file-presence. So the real fix is
  the LAYER SETUP: the layers (SYSTEM/OEM/USR) must be created+populated in the DataStore (`DataStore::
  AddLayer`) before `ReadConfigDataDir`; that depends on the control-mark→`GetOptionTable`→layers or a
  config-init step. Chain pinned end-to-end: ReadConfigDataSet→ReadConfigDataDir→ReadDir→PathName→
  RetrieveLayer(EMPTY)→IsAFile=false→loop skipped. NEXT: find `DataStore::AddLayer`'s caller + what populates
  the layer. (Method: base stable per identical-setup → `-d in_asm -dfilter` traces are viable.)
  ★★★ CONTROL-MARK VALUE RESOLVED (2026-06-23, the tracker's open "control-mark VALUE" question) — but
  NECESSARY-NOT-SUFFICIENT for the layers. Disassembled `OptionLib::GetOptionTable(CfgControlMark,SikGeneration)`
  @libOptions.so 0x19470: for **SikGeneration==0** (the demo/no-dongle path) it does `idx = controlmark - 6`,
  bounds-checks `idx<=0x15`, and jumps a 22-entry table (vaddr 0x6500c) to an in-code `OptionBuilder::GetOptionTable*`.
  Decoded the table: **controlmark `0x10`(16) → `GetOptionTableTnc640`** (Tnc620=0x0e, Tnc128=6, Tnc320=7,
  ManualPlus620=0x0b, CncPilot640=0x0c, Pnc610=0x14, …); **controlmark `0`** (what EVERY prior session wrote!)
  → `idx = 0-6` underflows → `>0x15` → **`GetOptionTableNone` = EMPTY option table** = the exact empty-layer
  symptom. So the *option table* is BUILT IN CODE from the control-mark — **NO dongle/SIK challenge** needed for
  the table STRUCTURE (the SIK only gates which individual options are *licensed*); this is the legitimate demo
  path. Set `controlmark.conf=16` + traced ConfigServer under FEX (`emulator/trace_cfgload.sh`, INJECT_REREAD on):
  ConfigServer **reads all 5 productid confs** (controlmark=16 consumed) and now **descends into `jh_int/layout`**
  (O_DIRECTORY) — BUT still opens **0 data .cfg/.atr** and IPO still fails `-k=NC`. ⇒ DECISIVE: the DataStore
  **layer population is INDEPENDENT of the option table** (controlmark=16 builds the OptionDef but does NOT fill
  `dataCollection`'s layer Rb_trees — `DataStore::FindLayer@0x249150`/`GetDataLayer` read `dataCollection[act*0x6c+4]`,
  populated elsewhere). So the tracker's hypothesis "control-mark→GetOptionTable→layers" is REFUTED for the file
  layers: controlmark=16 is necessary (correct option table, productid read, jh_int/layout descended) but the
  empty-layer gate is a SEPARATE mechanism. Also confirmed: ConfigServer's `encDir` tries to encfs-mount jh_int
  and FAILS (`error encfs: 1` — encfs/fusermount not on its PATH in this run) then continues, reading jh_int as a
  plain dir; populating jh_int flat (65 cfg/atr + layout) did NOT change the 0-data-opens result (the gate is the
  empty DataStore layer-array, not file presence). Ghidra's decomp of `CfgStore::DataFile`/`ReadConfigDataDir` is
  exception-`.cold`-garbled (unusable); the layer-creator must be found via runtime trace. NEXT (the real, still-open
  gate): who inserts into `dataCollection`'s layer Rb_tree (`_M_insert_unique<Lyr::LayerNr>`@0x1509e0) — likely a
  config-init/per-client step the standalone ConfigServer never reaches, i.e. the constellation per-client state.
  ★★★ CONFIG #6 — CONCLUSIVE CHARACTERIZATION (2026-06-23): this session removed THREE sub-blockers and
  isolated the gate. (1) **encfs password CONFIRMED at runtime = `Yomxn8YJyvrbNli62Rpl`** (`emulator/
  trace_encfs.sh` straced encDir's `-S` stdin write; fixed/deterministic, NOT the dongle). (2) **the encfs
  config store CAN be populated + MOUNTED under FEX**: `emulator/run_cfg_encfs_test.sh` creates a fresh
  `_jh_int` with `encfs --standard -S`+that password, encrypts the real config (65 .cfg/.atr + layout) in,
  and ConfigServer's `encDir` **mounts the populated store** (`encdir: mounted ... started`, no `error
  encfs:1` — that earlier ELFCLASS64 was the `/etc`-bind→`LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` leak
  of the 64-bit host libfuse into the i386 guest; run WITHOUT binding /etc + create `/dev/shm/_heusrv_shm`
  or ConfigServer segfaults in run-up). The residual `error encfs:127` is encDir's encfs spawn inside its
  OWN `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` not finding fusermount — a FEX+unshare+FUSE detail, NOT the gate. (3)
  **controlmark=16** builds GetOptionTableTnc640 (see the control-mark map above). ★ DECISIVE: even with a
  populated jh_int + controlmark=16 (`trace_cfgload.sh`), ConfigServer descends into `jh_int/layout`
  (O_DIRECTORY) but **opens ZERO data .cfg/.atr** → IPO still `-k=NC`. ⇒ the gate is NOT file-presence, NOT
  the option table, NOT the encfs — it is the **DataStore per-client layer REGISTRATION** (ReadConfigDataDir
  prologue `_Rb_tree<astring,Client>::find` on the client map → empty layer file-array → ReadDir false →
  loop skipped), populated only by the running constellation's clients (the chicken-and-egg). So Track B
  carries ConfigServer through RTOS run-up + connect(INJECT_ACK) + productid(cm=16) + a POPULATED+MOUNTED
  encfs store — to the per-client layer-registration gate, which needs the constellation. The three former
  sub-blockers (password / store-population / option-table) are SOLVED; this is the precise current frontier.
  ★ PROGRESS: with the productid confs provided, ConfigServer NOW **stats 53 config files** in
  `/mnt/sys/config/jh_int` (`newfstatat` OK on `tnc.cfg`/`ChannelCfg.atr`/`GlobalSystemCfg.atr`/…) — so the
  productid genuinely unblocks the IsAFile/SetupDirInfo stating path (it WAS necessary). BUT they're STAT-ed,
  never OPENED (0 `openat` on data files), IPO still fails `-k=NC`. New clue: strace shows UNRESOLVED path
  VARIABLES `%SYS%/config/layout/{uniquenumbers,measureunittable}.xml`, `%OEM%/config/version.cfg`,
  `%OEM%/_mpupdate/plce.zip` stat-ed LITERALLY (=ENOENT) — `ConfigHelper::ReplacePath` is NOT substituting
  `%SYS%`/`%OEM%` (distinct from the `SYS:\…` volume form which DOES resolve to jh_int). cwd symlinks
  `"%SYS%"`→/mnt/sys didn't take (needs ReplacePath subst, not a literal dir). Two remaining gates: (1) the
  `%SYS%`/`%OEM%` ReplacePath substitution (layout/oem loads fail→likely abort), (2) data files stat-ed but
  not OPENED (ReadDataFiles→ReadHeader gated, perhaps by the %VAR% abort). The 53 stats (SetupDirInfo path)
  vs runtime-trace "ReadDir returns false" (ReadConfigDataDir path) = multiple code paths.
  ★ RE'd `ConfigHelper::ReplacePath` (it's in **libbackend-server.so** @0x1a390, 1-arg / @0x1a430 3-arg):
  it substitutes **`%oemPath%`/`%usrPath%`** (calls `FFallback::Apply(Volume,…)`/`FSystemPathname::sys()`/
  `FUserToTicket::Ticket`) — NOT `%SYS%`/`%OEM%`. The strace `%OEM%/config/version.cfg` is a SEPARATE literal
  template; those `%SYS%`/`%OEM%` paths are secondary config (layout XML, OEM version), substituted by a
  different mechanism, and are NOT the channel config — so the `%VAR%` lead is a SIDE ISSUE, not the gate.
  ⇒ The real blocker stands: the **load path** — ReadConfigDataDir's `ReadDir`→`PathName(0,layer)` returns an
  invalid path (empty layer file-array OR LayerNr mismatch vs step-1 `DataFile`) → `IsAFile` false → loop
  skipped → data files never OPENED. The productid unblocked SetupDirInfo's STATING (53 files) but a DIFFERENT
  code path than the load. NEXT: trace step-1 `DataFile` LayerNr vs ReadDir's PathName LayerNr (the empty-array
  cause); the layers exist but their file-array is empty for the load path. Productid DONE; stating WORKS; the
  load is gated on the empty layer-file-array (not the %VAR%).
  ★ ReadConfigDataDir@0x2150a0 is PER-CLIENT: its prologue does `_Rb_tree<astring,Client>::find` on the CLIENT
  MAP (key = member -0x10c8(esi)) BEFORE the layer/file work. So the empty layer-array is bound to per-client
  config state that standalone ConfigServer (no MMI/AppStartMP constellation to populate clients+layers)
  doesn't have. ⇒ HONEST: blocker #6 is the documented MULTI-COMPONENT config frontier — per-client config +
  DataStore layers + registration + productid + encfs + channel load — pinned PRECISELY (empty layer
  file-array in the per-client load path) but NOT completable incrementally; each gate reveals another
  (encfs→productid→layer→per-client). Solid wins: #5 connect + productid synth + config-file stating + gate
  pinned. The full-system qemu path (real boot populates clients/layers/productid) is the route to a FULLY
  running control. Track B reached the config-subsystem frontier.
  ★ EMPIRICAL CONFIRMATION (binary-patch test): NOP'd the gate branch `0x215285 je 0x215588` in a copy of
  libConfigSystem.so (LD_PRELOAD, same soname) to FORCE the registration loop to run past ReadDir-false.
  Result: STILL 0 data files opened, IPO still fails -k=NC, no crash. ⇒ the gate is NOT the single branch —
  forced past it, the loop STILL can't register/load because the underlying per-client/layer state (the
  DataStore layer's file-array) is empty. Bypassing the branch doesn't conjure the populated layer the loop
  needs. This CONFIRMS the config-data load needs the multi-process constellation's per-client/layer state,
  not a code-path tweak. Definitive: Track B's userspace emulator carries the control to the config frontier
  (connect + productid + stating) but the data load requires the full-system boot's state.
  ★ CONSTELLATION PATH (the way to populate that state) — DEMONSTRATED under the emulator on ARM64: AppStartMP
  (the process manager that writes the productid + spawns the constellation) blocked at "PLIB++ waiting for
  X-Server" → provided **Xvfb** (`:99`, native ARM64) → passed; then "PLIB++ waiting for X-WindowManager" →
  provided **openbox** (twm fails on missing fonts; openbox uses DISPLAY env not --display) → passed. With
  X+WM, AppStartMP now SPAWNS the constellation — forks `heuseradmin` + children which fail
  `Cannot connect to stream socket: Connection refused` (peer servers not up). So under qemu-i386+emulator+
  Xvfb+openbox, AppStartMP runs and reaches the constellation-spawn stage, but the children need the FULL set
  of HeROS servers wired up (heusrv/the message bus/the config server/the Qt MMI). The productid cache is
  written only once that constellation comes up — so it's still absent. ⇒ the documented full-GUI-boot
  constellation IS reachable as a path on ARM64 (X+WM provided) but completing it = bringing up every server
  + the Qt MMI = the documented frontier. NEXT (full-boot path): start the HeROS
  service constellation (heusrv etc.) so AppStartMP's children wire up + the productid/layers populate.

  (the NCK), ipo_export, … So "fully run the control" = boot ALL 92 processes (each its own qemu-i386 +
  heroscall-emulator instance) wired together, culminating in the Qt MMI HrMmi.elf. That IS the documented
  full-system/GUI boot — feasible only up to the Qt MMI. Track B
  (userspace emulator) is proven to carry the INDIVIDUAL processes (NCK, ConfigServer) through RTOS/kernel
  init + connect + the config frontier, and the orchestrator AppStartMP RUNS on ARM64 (Xvfb+openbox) and
  spawns the constellation — but booting all 92 + the Qt MMI is the full-system path, not an incremental
  emulator step. This is the genuine, mapped endpoint of Track B.
  ★ BOOT-ORDER dependency confirmed empirically: binfmt_misc IS registered+enabled for qemu-i386 (flags POF,
  /usr/bin/qemu-i386), so i386 children auto-launch under qemu (set `QEMU_LD_PREFIX=$rootfs` so they find the
  sysroot). With Xvfb+openbox+binfmt, AppStartMP forks `heuseradmin`, which STALLS on `Cannot connect to
  stream socket: Connection refused` — it needs **`heuserver`** (`$rootfs/usr/sbin/heuserver`, the HeROS
  user/login server), a SYSTEM SERVICE the real boot starts via `/etc/init.d` BEFORE AppStartMP. So the full
  boot = the HeROS init scripts + system services (heuserver, message bus, …) + AppStartMP + the 92-process
  constellation + the Qt MMI — i.e. replicating the ENTIRE HeROS boot process-by-process under qemu-user,
  each service gating the next down to HrMmi.elf. That is definitively the full-system path (the documented
  qemu-system-x86_64 route boots all of it natively), not an incremental userspace-emulator step. Track B's
  proven reach: individual processes through RTOS/kernel init + connect + config frontier, and the
  orchestrator launching under X+WM. The full multi-process+GUI boot is the documented frontier.
  ★★★ DECISIVE BOUNDARY (empirical): tried to start `heuserver -d` (the user/login server AppStartMP's
  heuseradmin needs). It CRASHES qemu-user: `ERROR:accel/tcg/cpu-exec.c:515: assertion failed:
  (cpu == current_cpu)` — a qemu-USER limitation (its per-process threading/signal model), and it also
  needs to write system files (`/etc/security/group.conf`). So the HeROS SYSTEM SERVICES cannot run under
  per-process qemu-user at all. The init.d boot is ~40+ services (dbus, heros, heros-auth-daemon, hessrv,
  heuinput, heuseradmin, … then applaunch→AppStartMP). ⇒ PROVEN: the full constellation boot requires
  FULL-SYSTEM emulation (`qemu-system-x86_64`, a real kernel running the whole HeROS Linux), NOT the
  userspace qemu-user + heroscall-emulator approach. Track B (userspace) definitively reaches: individual
  COMPUTE processes (NCK/ConfigServer) through RTOS/kernel init + connect + config frontier, and AppStartMP
  launching under X+WM — but the SYSTEM SERVICES + GUI boot are a full-system-emulation concern. This is the
  empirically-proven boundary between Track B (userspace) and the full-system route.
  ★ WORKAROUND-TESTED (hard limit): retried heuserver with qemu `-one-insn-per-tb` (disables TB chaining —
  the usual fix for that assertion) AND with /etc/security writable — SAME crash `cpu_exec_longjmp_cleanup:
  assertion (cpu == current_cpu)`, and heuserver dies during user/group setup (adding root to groups
  vboxsf/oem/plce, reading /etc/sysconfig) BEFORE binding the socket (0 listen/bind). So the qemu-user limit
  is NOT flag-avoidable — the HeROS system daemons' thread/signal/credential model is fundamentally
  incompatible with per-process qemu-user. (Earlier wording "the userspace heros-emulator cannot boot the
  system services" was an OVER-CLAIM — see the FEX correction below; the limit is qemu-USER-specific.)
  ★★★ CORRECTION — the boundary is qemu-USER-specific, NOT universal (2026-06-22): installed **FEX-Emu**
  (`fex-emu-armv8.0`, PPA ppa:fex-emu/fex has a candidate for Ubuntu 26.04 resolute) — a DIFFERENT i386→ARM64
  userspace translator that runs UNDER the heros-emulator (it replaces only the qemu translation layer, so
  it's still "the heros emulator on arm64"). FEX runs heuserver with **ZERO `cpu_exec` assertions** — the
  qemu-user crash is GONE. So my 5-way "hard limit" was qemu-user-specific; the HeROS system services are
  NOT fundamentally un-runnable in userspace. CAVEAT: FEX's i386 (32-bit) support segfaults (exit 139) on the
  BARE control rootfs — even a dynamic i386 busybox — because FEX needs a proper FEX-format RootFS, not the
  raw $rootfs (config: /root/.fex-emu/Config.json `{"Config":{"RootFS":"<dir>"}}`; sudo→HOME=/root). NEXT
  (the genuine open avenue): build a FEX RootFS = FEXRootFSFetcher base + the control's i386 libs overlaid
  (reconcile glibc 2.31), then run heuserver→AppStartMP→the constellation under FEX + the heros-emulator
  preload. Remaining blockers regardless of translator: writable credential env (/etc/security, /mnt/plc/etc/
  shadow, the user/group DB) + the ~40 services + the Qt MMI HrMmi.elf. So: NOT exhausted — FEX is the
  untested-but-promising path that clears the specific qemu-user crash.
  ★★★ BREAKTHROUGH (FEX runs the control's i386 binaries — 2026-06-22): solved the FEX RootFS. FEX 32-bit
  WORKS (a STATIC i386 binary printed + exit 0; a DYNAMIC i386 binary with modern glibc too). The control's
  segfault was purely the **glibc-2.31 rootfs**: glibc is backward-compatible, so a MODERN i386 glibc runs
  the 2.31-linked control binaries. Recipe: `dpkg --add-architecture i386 + apt install libc6:i386
  libstdc++6:i386`, then an **overlayfs RootFS** = `lowerdir=<modern-glibc-/lib>:<control $rootfs>` (modern
  glibc on TOP of the control tree). Result: the control's own i386 busybox runs under FEX
  (`CONTROL_BUSYBOX_OK`). Then **heuserver under FEX + the heros-emulator preload: ZERO cpu_exec assertions
  (qemu-user crash GONE), heros emulator loaded, and it runs ALL THE WAY THROUGH its credential setup** —
  group adds, config read, shadow/group.conf handling — failing only on ENVIRONMENT (read-only /mnt/plc/etc,
  absent credential DB + /etc/sysconfig/heuseradmin cfg, cross-device /etc/security rename EXDEV) + a late
  segfault from the failed ops. ⇒ DEFINITIVELY: the HeROS system services ARE runnable on ARM64 via
  **FEX + the heros emulator**; the qemu-user "hard limit" is fully refuted. The remaining work is HeROS
  ENVIRONMENT setup (writable credential dirs + the user/group/shadow DB + the heuseradmin config + FEX path
  mapping so /tmp & /etc/security share a fs), then heuserver→AppStartMP→constellation. Repro: overlay
  rootfs at /tmp/fexroot; FEX config /root/.fex-emu/Config.json RootFS=/tmp/fexroot; preloads copied into
  the rootfs /lib. NEXT: set up heuserver's credential environment so it binds its socket.
- Fallback that works today: full-system `qemu-system-x86_64`/UTM (real heros.ko loads) — doc 16 §6.

### Reproduce
- **heroscall emulator on ARM64 (the actual target, runs locally — no x86_64 box needed): `emulator/run_2proc_arm64.sh`**
  via lima VM `tnc` + qemu-i386 (build the `.so` in-VM with `i686-linux-gnu-gcc`; see docs/17 §"Runs on ARM64").
  IPO + ConfigServer fully reproduce the frontier on aarch64 (cross-process futexes work under qemu-i386).
- heroscall emulator, native x86_64: `emulator/run_2proc_config.sh` / `run_nck.sh` (see `docs/17-heroscall-emulator.md`)
- Translation + dep-closure + device shim: `scripts/arm64_translate_poc.sh`
- Recompile proof: `recomp/build_and_verify.sh`

---

## Triage facts (key numbers, for orientation)
- 335 ELF objects, **ALL i386 (Intel 80386), zero x86-64** = 87 executables (`.elf`) + 248 libraries
  (`.so`). All dynamically linked, interpreter `/lib/ld-linux.so.2`, **not stripped** (symbols
  present → legible decompilation). Largest: `ipo_progstation.elf` 8.2 MB (NCK interpolator).
- Honest limit: Ghidra pseudo-C ≠ buildable source for the C++ product;. 
  Decompilation's real use here = interface recon for shims;
  per-leaf-function recompile is what's been proven (see recomp tables).

## Lessons / tooling caveats (carry these forward)
- **Rosetta is x86-64-only** → it CANNOT translate this i386 control. (Relevant on macOS; on a real
  x86_64 host this whole problem disappears — see migration notes.)
- **rz-ghidra is NOT a brew formula** — use full Ghidra (`analyzeHeadless` + the post-script).
- Native `objdump` in an ARM64 lima VM can't disassemble i386 ("architecture UNKNOWN"); use
  `i686-linux-gnu-objdump`. (On x86_64, plain `objdump`/`gcc -m32` work natively.)
- Host↔lima-VM mount was READ-ONLY → built in VM `/tmp` + `limactl copy` back; patchelf ran host-side.
- **x87 fistp/fisttp** integer conversions of 80-bit intermediates near integer boundaries are NOT
  cleanly reproducible on ARM SSE; `fisttpl(inf)=0x80000000` (x87 indefinite). This is why a few FP
  fns (e.g. `FCYC_AnzahlSchichten`, `BCYC_*` originally) were excluded from the byte-identical bar.
- **Cycle libs are function-pointer-table architectures** (esp. `libEp90_Drehcyc`): most "exports"
  are runtime-registered forwarder thunks (`jmp *GOT`), NOT reimplementable. Filter real leaves by
  "has `fld`/`fmul` AND no `@plt` AND no indirect `jmp`/`call *`".
- When Ghidra's decomp ABI looks confused/pointless (e.g. a function typed `void` that actually
  tail-returns a value in `eax`/`st0`), **disassemble** — the eax/st0 passthrough tail-return and
  true arg order are recoverable from the stack-slot shuffles (`dmathe_PktAufBogen`,
  `get_einfahr_radius` were recovered this way).
- A recompile candidate must be **EXPORTED in `.dynsym`** to serve as the truth oracle — local
  symbols (`hexbyte`, `FlModAccess`, `SlowPgmGetTaskIndex`, …) are genuine machine code but not
  dynamically linkable, so they can't be diffed against.

## Migration notes: moving the RE work to x86_64 (2026-06-21)
**Why:** decompilation/recompilation/verification is far easier on a native x86_64 host — no qemu,
no cross-compiler, no lima VM, no read-only-mount dance.

What changes on x86_64 (vs the Apple-Silicon M2 Max setup documented above):
- The i386 control runs **natively** (32-bit on x86_64 via multilib) — no `qemu-i386`, no
  translation layer. The whole "TRANSLATION PORT ROADMAP / heroscall" story is an ARM64-specific
  concern; on x86_64 the original HeROS `heros.ko` kernel module can load for the full-system route.
- Build/verify recompiled libs with native `gcc -m32` (install `gcc-multilib` / `glibc-devel.i686`).
  No `gcc-i686-linux-gnu` cross-compiler needed; plain `objdump`/`gdb` handle i386.
- The verification target on x86_64 is the genuine i386 `.so` running **natively** as the oracle
  (still apply the same trim-NEEDED / stub-soname / neuter-ctors recipe so the leaf loads
  standalone). Byte-identical (`recomp/*/`) results should reproduce; behavioral-FP results may now
  match the oracle even MORE closely (no qemu x87 emulation in the loop) — re-run
  `build_and_verify*.sh` to confirm and adjust tolerances if anything tightens.
- Still install: Ghidra 12.1.2 + JDK 21 (headless decompile pipeline is host-arch-agnostic),
  patchelf, rizin. The `recomp/*` artifacts named `*_arm64.dylib`/`*_aarch64.so` are ARM outputs;
  regenerate x86_64/`.so` equivalents as needed (the `.text` of verified fns is genuine and unchanged).
- IDA Pro MCP tools are available in this environment (see `mcp__ida-pro-mcp__*`) — an alternative/
  complement to the Ghidra headless pipeline for the heavier decompile work on the new host.

Open work still pending (unchanged by the move): more `libEp90_Gtlib` single-field classifiers
(~40 IsGewinde-style candidates), `libplckernel` integer accessors, un-scanned libs. The recomp set
is explicitly **NOT exhausted**.

---

## x86_64 native migration COMPLETE + IDA + new work (2026-06-21) — `ssh pawel`

The migration to x86_64 (above) is **done and proven**. The host is a Ryzen Windows box reached via
`ssh pawel`; the workhorse is its **WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04**. Full mechanics in memory
`project-x86_64-native-verify` and `recomp/x86_64_native/README.md`. Highlights:

- **Native verification pipeline works (no qemu).** No-sudo 32-bit toolchain (`~/tnc/m32gcc`, deb
  `apt-get download` + `dpkg -x`), universal auto oracle-load recipe (trim non-glibc NEEDED, supply
  versioned stubs for VERNEED sonames, neuter init, weak `ret` stub for unversioned proprietary
  syms), tolerant comparator (`recomp/x86_64_native/{nverify.sh,fpdiff.py}`).
- **All 25 prior recomp libs re-validated natively:** 22 byte-IDENTICAL (same SHA-256) + 3
  FP-EQUIVALENT (anfahr/dmathe/geolib). IMPORTANT correction: the M2 "0 ULP" FP claims were a
  **qemu x87-emulation artifact**; on real x87 hardware the FP-geometry libs differ by a few ULP —
  max **relative** error ~1e-14 (negligible, sub-femtometer). `file` lib has one cosmetic OOB-read
  harness artifact in its negative bit-index sweep (84/85 rows exact).
- **IDA Pro (idalib 9.2) works directly** via the mrexodia venv python (`ida_list.py`/`ida_decomp.py`
  in `D:\TNC\ida\`); the `mcp__ida-pro-mcp__*` tools wired to the Mac session do NOT connect.
- **NEW: `recomp/gtlib2/` — 13 new `GTFIND_*` classifiers** decompiled with IDA off libEp90_Gtlib.so,
  reimplemented via the per-arch named-field-struct technique, verified **byte-IDENTICAL** (same
  SHA-256, 46080 vectors, native i386 oracle vs native x86_64 rebuild). ARM64 deliverables built:
  `libEp90_Gtlib2_arm64.dylib` (macOS) + `libEp90_Gtlib2_aarch64.so` (Linux, via no-sudo
  `~/tnc/a64gcc` cross-compiler). Functions: IsAbflach/IsMehrkant/IsMuster/IsFigur/IsBohrung(akopf)/
  IsRohr/IsStange/IsTasche/IsRucksackTyp/IsGeoKomplett/IsGeoError/IsLine/IsCirc. Skipped HasRuck
  (IDA-garbled sparse bitmask) + IsHorLine/IsVertLine (call non-leaf `stg_element`).
- **NEW: `recomp/geometri2/` — 2 new coordinate-type classifiers** (`IsPolaresLaengenInkrement`,
  `IsPolaresWinkelInkrement`) completing the libEp90_Geometri family; reimplemented as flat
  dword-array readers (mask selects field idx 54/55/60/61, gated by 22/23, `&0x126 == K`),
  verified **byte-IDENTICAL** (5 fns incl. the 3 prior, 1344 vectors). ARM64 deliverables built.
- **More new batches (all IDA-decompiled, native-verified IDENTICAL, ARM64 built, committed):**
  `aeplib` (6 flat-field: SchlittenInKanal/MehrSpindler/chk_zustellung/VorschubTyp/ElementNichtBearbeiten/
  set_ovsi_0), `aeplib2` (3 Bam list-mutators, per-arch list), `dcsiface` (5 DcsInterface:: flat-this:
  _cfgYAxis/_isAxisAvailable[Ch]/KernOpenSpm/KernOpenWkz), `spurgen` (SwapN buffer-reverse, Box_erweitern
  bbox min/max), `geocontours` (6 libgeolibcontours flat-this predicates incl. self-ptr PocketsDefined),
  `geoxcontour` (16 libgeoextendedcontour accessors: ValueRange<uint|double> min/max/span/empty/valid +
  SplittableValueRange getters + FixedGridHash cell_*), `geoxcontour2` (12 setters: CleaningGroup fluent
  setters + ValueRange set_min/set_max).
- **IDA leaf-scanner (`D:\TNC\ida\ida_scan.py`):** lists exported leaf candidates (size 7-400, no internal
  callees — libc/import/thunk callees allowed). KEY: high-level C++ libs (libtnc/libGeoModule/libPlc*/
  libStartUpCtrl/etc.) are leaf-POOR (orchestration); the leaf-RICH libs are the low-level computational
  ones — esp. **libgeolibcontours (136 cand) and libgeoextendedcontour (215 cand)** still have many more.
- **Project total: 278 verified functions** (started this migration at 200; +8 `libEp90_Gtlib` GTFIND_Is*
  classifiers 2026-06-22 — reproduced ENTIRELY on the Mac (host Ghidra decompile + lima-VM qemu-i386 oracle),
  proving the recompile/verify track is fully actionable without the x86_64 box; the +2 `IsCirCW`/`IsCirCCW`
  also extend the byte-identical bar to FP SIGN-COMPARISON, a new admissible class). Still NOT exhausted.
- Deferred (need disasm or are non-leaves): GTFIND_HasRuck (garbled bitmask), GeometryTools::
  is_value_inside_range (garbled FP), is_consistent family (call externals), SplittableValueRange::
  set_range/set_number_of_samples (cold paths). Build helper: `recomp/x86_64_native/build_arm64.sh`.

### heuserver user-admin DB schema (decompiled 2026-06-22, the FEX-path next gate)
Decompiled libheusercfg.so (work/re/out/libheusercfg.decomp.c, 8807 lines, Ghidra). heuserver's
/etc/sysconfig/heuseradmin/heuseradmin.cfg is a GKeyFile permission model with sections:
[Global] (Active/Anonymous/Domain), [Roles], [Permissions], [Rights], [LegacyRoles] (NC/PLC/HEROS),
[FunctionUsers] (PWTYPEDEFAULT/PWTYPEOEM/PAMPYTHON/OEMPYTHON + per-user keys), [PlcModule9285],
[Textdomain] (DIRNAME/DOMAIN). The role→permission→rights model + the function-user/password tables are
the user-admin DB CONTENT (install-generated, internally coherent), so a syntactically-complete config
still needs valid model content to pass heuserver's validation + then the writable credential env
(/etc/group GIDs, /mnt/plc/etc/shadow, /etc/security). This is the decompiled artifact for constructing
the DB; the FEX path (control binaries run on ARM64) makes building it the genuine next sub-project.

### heuserver CORRECTION: it SELF-GENERATES the config (2026-06-22) — blocker is the writable env, not the DB
Decompiled libheusercfg shows heuserver `g_key_file_save_to_file`s /etc/sysconfig/heuseradmin/heuseradmin.cfg
("#Auto-generated by heuserver; Do not edit", decomp line 6050) — i.e. heuserver CREATES the default
user-admin DB itself (the NC/PLC/HEROS role/permission model + function-users), it does NOT need an
install-supplied config. So the earlier framing ("construct the coherent permission DB") was wrong; the real
heuserver gate is the WRITABLE CREDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT for its self-init writes: /etc/sysconfig/heuseradmin/,
/etc/security/group.conf (EXDEV — heuserver renames /tmp/__group.conf.new there; needs same-fs, e.g.
/etc/security -> a host /tmp symlink under FEX), /mnt/plc/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd|group|shadow, + the keyfile.
Under FEX the testing is noisy (the preload loads inconsistently; foreground exits 1 with empty output vs -d
segfaulting in the daemon/fork path) — so the next step is a clean, fully-writable same-fs credential env +
stable preload so heuserver self-initializes and binds. This is more tractable than a permission-model build
but still gated by the FEX env plumbing. Path stays: heuserver self-init+bind -> AppStartMP -> constellation.

### ★★★ heuserver RUNS its full credential setup under FEX (2026-06-22) — root-check + emulator solved ★★★
Got heuserver from "no output / silent exit" to running its COMPLETE credential provisioning observably on
ARM64, via three fixes:
  1. **Run as the UNPRIVILEGED user, not sudo.** FEX runs the control's i386 binaries fine as my user, but
     NOT under sudo — the lima VM's uid-501 host-mapping is unresolvable (`sudo: user 'current user' not
     found`), which breaks sudo + permission-dependent paths. (Static/dynamic i386 verified working as my
     user; sudo runs silently fail.)
  2. **emulator/fakeroot.c** (new LD_PRELOAD, loaded FIRST): geteuid/getuid->0 so heuserver passes its
     `Only root can run heuserver!` check; chown/chmod/setgroups->0 (no-op the privileged ops). Build:
     i686-linux-gnu-gcc -shared -fPIC -O2 -o fakeroot.so emulator/fakeroot.c.
  3. **Fresh /dev/shm names in heros_rtos.c** (sed heros_rtos_ctl->hrctlU501, heros_reg_->hregU501_) so the
     unprivileged user creates its own control segment (the old one was a root-owned 403MB 0600 leftover,
     EACCES; sudo couldn't remove it). [rtos] control segment created -> the emulator now inits.
With this + a FEX overlay rootfs, heuserver runs FULLY: parses the NC/PLC/HEROS legacy roles, provisions
function-users (addgroup/adduser via busybox symlinks), creates /etc/netgroup, sets file perms, GENERATES
/etc/sysconfig/heuseradmin/heuseradmin.cfg. This is the FURTHEST heuserver has reached — its actual setup.
REMAINING (one blocker): file WRITES fail (changeOemPasswd /etc/passwd.new, the keyfile temp, /tmp/
__group.conf.new, /etc/security/groups) = "Permission denied", because the overlay/virtiofs writes are
gated by the SAME unresolvable-uid-501 degradation (my-user-owned overlay upper still denies writes; the
virtiofs lowerdir $R is owned by the unresolvable uid 501, so overlayfs permission checks fail). This is a
VM-infrastructure degradation, NOT the emulator: a FRESH VM (where uid 501 resolves -> real root/sudo works,
or the rootfs isn't a virtiofs mount) lets the writes succeed and heuserver bind. NEXT: fresh VM/environment
-> heuserver self-init+bind -> heuseradmin connects -> AppStartMP -> the constellation, all under FEX.

### heuserver bind: blocked by VM-degradation stuck files (2026-06-22) — local writable rootfs WORKS for /etc
Built a LOCAL my-user-owned rootfs (no overlay/virtiofs/sudo) to make heuserver's writes succeed:
closure-trace heuserver's NEEDED libs (libheusercfg/libjhvolume/libpam/libglib-2.0/libcrypto/libhenetstat
+ transitive, ~25 libs) from work/target/rootfs into /var/tmp/lr/lib (ext4, 90G free; /tmp is tmpfs/RAM
so use /var/tmp), + busybox + the modern i386 glibc on top + the preloads + busybox helper symlinks +
writable /etc. FEX RootFS=/var/tmp/lr. RESULT: heuserver runs its FULL setup and **/etc writes now succeed**
("Create new /etc/netgroup" works) -- the local writable rootfs solved the overlay-permission wall.
REMAINING (one VM artifact): heuserver hardcodes /tmp/__group.conf.new; **FEX maps the guest /tmp to the
HOST /tmp** (verified: a pre-placed /var/tmp/lr/tmp/__group.conf.new is ignored), and host
/tmp/__group.conf.new is a STUCK root-owned file (1969B, from an earlier WORKING-sudo run at 09:47) that my
user cannot remove (sticky /tmp + sudo broken + userns blocked: uid_map EPERM). Same for the 403MB root-owned
/dev/shm/heros_rtos_ctl. These leftover-root files (from before the uid-501 drift) block the my-user runs and
can't be cleared without root. ⇒ heuserver is ONE clean step from binding: a FRESH VM (clears /tmp + /dev/shm,
restores uid-501 so sudo/root works) lets heuserver complete + bind. All the hard parts are solved (run as
user, fakeroot root-check, fresh-shm emulator, local writable rootfs, /etc writes); only the stuck-file VM
artifact remains. NEXT: fresh VM -> heuserver binds -> heuseradmin -> AppStartMP -> constellation under FEX.

### ★★★ heuserver SETUP COMPLETES under FEX on ARM64 — VM restart recovered the env (2026-06-22) ★★★
The mid-session VM degradation (uid-501 unresolvable -> sudo broken; stuck root-owned /tmp + /dev/shm
files) was cleared by `limactl restart tnc`: uid-501 resolves again, `sudo whoami`->root, /tmp + /dev/shm
clean, /var/tmp/lr (local rootfs) preserved. With REAL root restored, heuserver runs its full setup AND
its writes complete. Last blocker fixed: heuserver writes /tmp/__group.conf.new then rename()s it to
/etc/security/group.conf; FEX maps guest /tmp to the HOST /tmp (tmpfs) while the rootfs /etc is ext4 ->
rename()=EXDEV. **emulator/renamefix.c** (LD_PRELOAD) retries EXDEV as copy+unlink -> "Updated
/etc/security/groups". heuserver now: parses NC/PLC/HEROS roles, provisions groups, creates /etc/netgroup,
updates /etc/security/groups = its credential-DB setup DONE under FEX/ARM64.
OPEN: heuserver EXITS after "Updated /etc/security/groups" (foreground one-shot; `-d` daemonizes but the
double-fork doesn't survive FEX, and daemon()->0 didn't keep it up -> it genuinely returns after setup).
Need to determine whether heuserver is a setup one-shot (its job = provision the DB, then exit 0, and a
SEPARATE serving instance/socket comes later) or has a serve loop that aborts on a missing peer. NEXT:
check heuserver exit code + its serve mechanism (socket/listen vs heros-queue) + the init.d invocation args.
Recovery recipe (after any VM restart): rebuild preloads from emulator/*.c; FEX RootFS=/var/tmp/lr;
run heuserver as `sudo env ... LD_PRELOAD=/lib/renamefix.so:/lib/herosapi_shim.so:/lib/heros_rtos.so`.
(SUPERSEDED — see next section: drop heros_rtos.so + contain /etc; binds the socket.)

### ★★★★ heuserver BINDS 127.0.0.1:19093 under FEX on ARM64 (2026-06-22) — the heuserver gate is CLEARED ★★★★
Two fixes cracked the long-standing heuserver blocker; heuserver now runs its full credential setup,
creates `/dev/shm/_heusrv_shm`, and **binds + listens on 127.0.0.1:19093** (the accept loop blocks =
healthy server). `ss -ltnp` shows `LISTEN 127.0.0.1:19093 users:(("FEXInterpreter",...,fd=5))`.
Reproduce: `emulator/run_heuserver_fex.sh foreground` (in VM tnc); helper `emulator/heu_diag.sh`.

1. **DROP `heros_rtos.so` FROM heuserver's preloads.** The RTOS emulator (heroscall syscall(222),
   needed by the i386 NCK/IPO) **SEGFAULTS heuserver** (exit 139, right after "Updated /etc/security/
   groups", before the socket). heuserver needs ONLY `herosapi_shim.so` (fakes /dev/herosapi) +
   `renamefix.so` (EXDEV /tmp→/etc copy+unlink). With heros_rtos: crash. Without it: reaches
   `heuserver: Created stream socket` (printed only after bind+listen+fcntl all succeed → it IS bound).
   So the prior "heuserver exits after setup" was this SEGFAULT, not a one-shot — heuserver IS a real
   TCP server (decompiled main: getuid→getopt(-d)→`FUN_0001ae00` credential setup→`FUN_00014890` shm
   `/_heusrv_shm`→socket(AF_INET) bind **127.0.0.1:19093** (sa_data 4a 95 7f 00 00 01) listen→
   `if(!-d || daemon(0,1)==0)` poll/accept loop). init.d/heuseradmin runs `heuserver -d`; exit 0/2=OK,
   3=fail (`FUN_00014890`/socket failed). libheuseradmin clients connect over this TCP socket on the MC.

2. **CONTAIN heuserver's /etc writes — FEX LEAKS them to the REAL guest /etc.** ROOT CAUSE of the
   recurring "VM degradation" found + PROVEN: FEX RootFS does **NOT** redirect absolute-path /etc
   *writes* to the rootfs — a static i386 probe writing `/etc/__x` lands in the **REAL guest /etc**,
   not `/var/tmp/lr/etc`. heuserver runs as root and rewrites /etc/passwd|group|shadow|security, so an
   unguarded run **WIPES the lima user out of guest /etc/passwd** → sshd "Permission denied (publickey)"
   → VM unreachable. FIX: run heuserver inside a mount namespace with the rootfs /etc bind-mounted over
   /etc: `sudo unshare -m bash -c 'mount --make-rprivate /; mount --bind /var/tmp/lr/etc /etc; …
   FEXInterpreter …/heuserver'`. Writes land in the contained rootfs etc; a md5 guard on real
   /etc/passwd confirms it stays unchanged. (FEX is dynamic → also set
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu` so it finds its libs past the bound /etc.)

**VM RECOVERY (this session): the guest /etc/passwd had ALREADY been corrupted** by a prior unguarded
heuserver run (the real guest passwd was wholesale-replaced with the HeROS control passwd — sys/oem/plce
/user, /bin/ash — and the lima `andreansx` user line removed; /etc/group + /etc/shadow still referenced
it). sshd rejected the (correct) key because the user no longer existed. `limactl restart`/`stop;start`
could NOT fix it (cloud-init re-provision blocked: lima regenerates cidata with a deterministic
instance-id). **Recovered via OFFLINE DISK SURGERY**: a throwaway helper lima VM (`~/.lima/_fixer.yaml`,
mounts `~/.lima/tnc` writable) → `losetup -fP ~/.lima/tnc/disk` → mount `loop0p1` (cloudimg-rootfs) →
restore `/etc/passwd` from the clean `/etc/passwd-` backup (which had `andreansx:x:501:6017:...:/home/
andreansx.guest:/bin/bash`) → umount/detach → `limactl start tnc`. SSH + sudo restored, all work intact
(`/var/tmp/lr`, FEX, toolchains). sudo grant was never lost (`/etc/sudoers.d/90-cloud-init-users`).

SERVING PATH VALIDATED + RTOS-FREE (confirmed). heuserver issues **ZERO heroscalls** (no syscall(222), no
t_ident/q_create/ev_*/m_attach in its decompile) and doesn't even open /dev/herosapi — it is a PURE socket
/credential server. So heros_rtos was never needed; it segfaults heuserver only because its syscall()/
sigaction() interposition hijacks SIGUSR1 (which heuserver uses). `emulator/heu_serve_test.sh`: a TCP client
CONNECTS to 19093, heuserver accepts it, reads the message, rejects a bad length (`Illegal data size …,
closing`), closes gracefully, and KEEPS LISTENING — no crash, RTOS-free, /etc guard SAFE. (Detail for the
real-client step: heuserver logged `pid 0 / connection (null)` — its AF_INET peer-uid extraction
(newTicketFromSocket → /proc/net/tcp → pid → uid) didn't identify the python client; a real heros client
auth will need that to resolve.) heuserver needs ONLY `renamefix.so` (+ harmless herosapi_shim).

REAL CLIENT END-TO-END HANDSHAKE VALIDATED (emulator/heu_client.c + heu_client_test.sh). A minimal C
client dlopen()s `libheuseradmin.so.1` (closure copied i386-correct into /var/tmp/lr: libglib-2.0/libpcre/
libcap — `cp -aL` to deref symlinks, else the i386 loader falls back to a 64-bit lib) and calls
**HEUTicketFromPid(getpid())**. RESULT: client logs `HEUTicketFromPid -> 0x1 (heuserver answered)`;
heuserver logs **`Client /usr/bin/FEXInterpreter was denied HEUTicketFromPid`**. So the FULL chain works:
real heros client code → connect 19093 → heuserver IDENTIFIES the peer (the python-probe `pid 0` is gone —
heuserver resolved the connecting process via /proc/PID/exe) → applies AUTHORIZATION → returns a decision.
"denied" is CORRECT (the client isn't a recognized privileged component).
★ FEX-MASKING BLOCKER SOLVED (emulator/fexunmask.c, an LD_PRELOAD for heuserver). Under FEX a client's
/proc/PID/exe = **`/usr/bin/FEXInterpreter`** (the translator), so heuserver's exe-path authorization
(`FUN_00019b70`: readlink /proc/PID/exe → `fnmatch` pattern table → priv bits) denied ALL FEX clients.
fexunmask interposes readlink(): for /proc/PID/exe it reads /proc/PID/cmdline and returns the REAL binary.
KEY (traced): **FEX rewrites cmdline argv[0] to the GUEST binary** (no "FEXInterpreter" prefix), so the
shim uses argv[0] when it's a path (else argv[1]). PROVEN: heuserver now logs the real path
(`Client /var/tmp/lr/tmp/testheuseradmin ...`) instead of FEXInterpreter. Add fexunmask.so to heuserver's
LD_PRELOAD (herosapi_shim:renamefix:fexunmask). Build: i686-linux-gnu-gcc -shared -fPIC -O2.
AUTH model fully RE'd: **HEUTicketFromPid needs priv bit 0x20** (heuserver @0x18210 line 6147:
`if ((client.priv & 0x20)==0) → "denied HEUTicketFromPid"`). priv bits come from matching the (now-real)
exe path against heuserver's pattern table (PTR_s___testheuseradmin_00027040); fnmatch flags 0x12 =
FNM_CASEFOLD|FNM_NOESCAPE (NO FNM_PATHNAME, so `*` spans `/`). Patterns (heuserver .rodata): `*/testheuseradmin`,
`/mnt/sys/heros5/bin*/*.elf`, `/usr/bin/heulaunch`, `/usr/bin/heoemuseradmin`, `…/ConfigServer*.elf`, etc.
★★ AUTHORIZATION FULLY SOLVED + GRANT DEMONSTRATED (no test hook). The priv-pattern table is STATIC in
heuserver .data @ELF 0x17040 (Ghidra 0x27040, base 0x10000): an array of {patternPtr(R_386_RELATIVE→.rodata),
privBits} pairs, NULL-terminated. Decoded it (objcopy .rodata + the reloc table). The FIRST entry
`*/testheuseradmin` has priv 0 by default, **set by the `-t <bits>` CLI flag** (main getopt 't'→FUN_00019b50→
DAT_00027044) — a TEST hook. Patterns granting **bit 0x20** (HEUTicketFromPid): **`/usr/bin/heulaunch`**
(priv 0x24) and **`/mnt/sys/heros5/bin*/Guppy*.elf`** (priv 0x120). The general `/mnt/sys/heros5/bin*/*.elf`
grants a LOWER priv (NOT 0x20) — correct (querying an arbitrary pid's ticket is sensitive, reserved for
heulaunch/Guppy). DEMONSTRATED grants 2 ways: (1) test hook — client named `testheuseradmin` + `heuserver
-t 32` → real ticket 0x4bfe648b (not the 0x1 deny sentinel); (2) **REAL pattern, no hook** — client staged
at `/usr/bin/heulaunch` → `HEUTicketFromPid -> 0x8aacd84f`, NO denial. fexunmask now also STRIPS the FEX
rootfs prefix (env FEXUNMASK_ROOTFS=/var/tmp/lr) so heuserver sees the GUEST/HeROS path (/usr/bin/heulaunch,
not /var/tmp/lr/usr/bin/heulaunch) its patterns expect. ⇒ heuserver authorizes FEX clients by their REAL
binary path; real constellation binaries (run from their real paths) get their proper privileges
AUTOMATICALLY, no config/hook needed. heuserver auth subsystem = SOLVED. Knobs in heu_client_test.sh:
UNMASK / CLIENT_REL / HEU_T / CLIENT_NAME.
★ BOOT ORDER MAPPED (etc/rc.d/rc5.d S-order) — heuserver's place + the road ahead:
`S20dbus → S23heros-auth-daemon → S40hessrv/S41hessrv2 → S60mbus → S71hepwdeamon →
**S77heuseradmin (=heuserver, NOW SOLVED)** → S78sshd → S79xstart (X server) → S81xfcestart →
**S85applaunch → AppStartMP → the 92-proc constellation → HrMmi.elf (Qt MMI)**`. So the proven heuserver
methodology (FEX + mount-ns /etc containment + the heros emulator + fexunmask for client auth) now applies
to the OTHER infra servers. Tractable next targets (each a server like heuserver): **hessrv** (S40, the
HeROS server), **mbus** (S60, the message bus), dbus/heros-auth-daemon/hepwdeamon — the prerequisites
AppStartMP's constellation children connect to. Then S79 X + S85 applaunch→AppStartMP. The full set + Qt MMI
remains the documented full-system frontier, but heuserver proves individual services boot this way on ARM64.
★ NEXT TARGET SCOUTED — hessrv (S40, /usr/sbin/hessrv): the HeROS identity/license/password RPC server.
SunRPC service over a UNIX socket (`/var/run/hessrv/hessrv.sock`); `svc_register(HESSRVPROG,HESSRVVERS)`;
procs `hessrv_getident/getproduct/getserialnumber/testlicensegetexpirationdate/pwplceget_2_svc`. Usage
`hessrv [--init-crypto]`. **RTOS-FREE** (0 heros RTOS syms, no /dev/herosapi) — same class as heuserver, so
the proven recipe applies. Anticipated blockers: (1) `/dev/JHncmem` HeROS shm device (shim like
herosapi_shim, or optional); (2) writable `/var/run/hessrv/` for the socket (mount-ns containment); (3) RPC
registration needs rpcbind/portmapper up (or local); (4) crypto helper (hessrv_crypto_helper.c, --init-crypto).
★ hessrv RUN — device blocker SOLVED, then hits the SIK/LICENSE boundary (emulator/run_hessrv_fex.sh).
Closure copied (libcrypto/libtirpc). First blocker was `/dev/JHncmem` (the SIK shm device): "Could not
open device file / map SIK device". FIX (reusable groundwork): upgraded `herosapi_shim.c` — (1) fake
`/dev/JHncmem` (added to is_heros_dev), (2) back fakes with a **4 MB zeroed memfd** (not /dev/zero) so
`mmap(MAP_SHARED,size)` works, (3) added **`__open_2`/`__open64_2`** (hessrv opens via the FORTIFIED
`__open_2@GLIBC_2.7`, which the shim didn't override — same fortified-variant lesson as fexunmask's
`__readlink`). Result: `faking open("/dev/JHncmem") -> fd 5 (memfd 4MB)`, device opens+maps. NEXT blocker
is **`SIK: Authentification failed (iTNC)! / Could not init SIK`** — hessrv IS the SIK RPC server; with a
**zeroed** memfd there is no SIK *state* present for it to read. ★ IMPORTANT FRAMING (corrected): this is
**NOT a licensing/legal barrier**. The TNC640 PGM-Platz is the FREE Heidenhain download and is *intended* to
run in **demo mode** with no dongle and no purchased license — that is how everyone uses it (Shareware/100-NC-
line cap, the legitimate path). There is **no license to buy and nothing to circumvent**. The demo SIK *state*
ships INSIDE the free image (flashed at install), so the honest task is a **technical state-repro** — provide
that demo SIK state to the FEX-native hessrv (from the free image / harvested guest state) — NOT defeating a
license. It is also unclear hessrv is even on the MMI render path: the 2-proc HrMmi setup reaches config + X
without hessrv running. The herosapi_shim memfd/__open_2 upgrades are reusable for other HeROS-device-mapping
servers. NEXT: either supply the demo SIK state to hessrv, or keep building the boot chain with the servers
that don't touch SIK at all (mbus message bus, dbus, heros-auth-daemon) / AppStartMP.

★ MORE INFRA SERVERS SCOUTED (boot-chain progress):
- **dbus (S20, /usr/bin/dbus-daemon --system) — UP under FEX** (emulator/run_dbus_fex.sh). RTOS-free,
  no license. Binds `/run/dbus/system_bus_socket` on the FIRST try (closure libdbus-1/libexpat; needs a
  machine-id + the system.conf, both provided). Contained: mount-ns + a PRIVATE tmpfs on /run so it never
  touches the VM's own dbus (verified VM dbus untouched). It "just works" — standard daemon, no
  HeROS-specific blocker. Foundational system bus = checked off.
- **mbus (S60) = `mbussrv` — HARDWARE-GATED, skip.** init.d does `modprobe ftdi_sio` + needs
  /etc/mbus/server.xml: it's the machine FTDI USB-SERIAL bus (real serial hardware / the I/O-sim). Not
  runnable standalone.
- **heros-auth-daemon (S23, /usr/sbin/heros-auth-daemon) — candidate next.** RTOS-free, no SIK; token-based
  auth over a unix socket (/var/run/auth_daemon/auth-daemon-srv.sock), uses dbus (now up) + FUSE
  (/var/run/auth_daemon/fs_mount/) + sssd (hepampol_sssd.conf). FUSE/sssd may complicate it.
- **heros-auth-daemon (S23) — LOADS + INITS under FEX, doesn't persist standalone** (emulator/run_authd_fex.sh).
  Big win on the closure: its heavy deps (libQt5Core, libprotobuf, libfuse, libicu*, libstdc++, libpcre2-16)
  all copy + run under FEX. It reads its config (`-c .../daemon.conf`, tolerates missing sections → defaults),
  parses AD/LDAP/secrets, and `-d` logs "Daemonizing process" — then gracefully "Stopping daemon / Stopped
  plugins / Updating all currently known secrets", binds NO socket. (`-v` = version 4.1.2, not verbose.) No
  captured error → the daemonized child either doesn't survive FEX's double-fork or an init condition is unmet
  — most likely the **FUSE token-filesystem mount** (`fuse_mountpoint /mnt/auth_daemon`; FUSE under FEX/qemu
  is the tracker's known-hard area) or a missing serve peer. Deeper dig than the clean wins; deferred.

BOOT-CHAIN SERVER SWEEP (this session) — heuserver methodology applied across the infra servers:
| svc | order | result |
|---|---|---|
| dbus | S20 | **UP** — binds system bus socket, clean (standard daemon) |
| heros-auth-daemon | S23 | **UP** (after FUSE win) — 2 FUSE mounts (certs + token fs) + binds srv_socket; needed the real daemon.conf |
| hessrv | S40 | device blocker SOLVED (memfd /dev/JHncmem), then **SIK/license boundary** |
| mbus | S60 | **hardware-gated** (FTDI serial / I/O-sim) — skip |
| heuserver | S77 | **FULLY SOLVED** — binds+serves+auth+fexunmask (the deep win) |
Pattern: some servers solve cleanly (heuserver, dbus); others hit hard boundaries (SIK license, FTDI hardware,
FUSE). NEXT options: (a) the FUSE-under-FEX problem (unblocks heros-auth-daemon + the encfs config store);
(b) attempt AppStartMP now heuserver+dbus are up (integration test → next real constellation blocker);
(c) more compute servers in the heuserver class (RTOS-free, self-contained).

★ 3-SERVER FOUNDATION RUNS TOGETHER UNDER FEX (2026-06-22, `emulator/run_3servers_fex.sh`) — the
documented AppStartMP prerequisite. dbus(S20) + heros-auth-daemon(S23) + heuserver(S77) brought up
SIMULTANEOUSLY in ONE contained mount-ns, all sockets bound at once: dbus `system_bus_socket`,
auth-daemon `auth-daemon-srv.sock` + 2 FUSE mounts (certs + fs_mount), heuserver `LISTEN 127.0.0.1:19093`
(6/14/10 FEX threads respectively). They COEXIST (distinct sockets/resources, no conflict). Per-server
preloads in one ns: dbus/auth-daemon = `herosapi_shim:renamefix`; heuserver = `herosapi_shim:renamefix:
fexunmask` (NO heros_rtos — segfaults heuserver). Real guest /etc/passwd md5 verified UNCHANGED (the
heuserver-as-root corruption guard holds with all three running). The boot-chain system-service substrate
that AppStartMP's constellation children connect to is now validated under one translator on ARM64.

★★ AppStartMP (S85, the constellation launcher) SCOUTED UNDER FEX — gates mapped: config(#6) → PLIB++ GUI
(2026-06-22, `emulator/run_appstart_fex.sh`). Ran AppStartMP under FEX against the 3-server foundation +
ConfigServer + Xvfb(:99) + openbox, contained (real /etc/passwd md5 unchanged). KEY DISCOVERY:
**AppStartMP is ITSELF a config CLIENT** — at startup (RTOS init → fork worker) it creates its own
CfgMailslot (`0000101CfgM`/`0-0000101CfgM`), `Q_ident "CfgServerQueue"`, `Q_send` a config request, then
`Q_read`-blocks for the reply. Run ALONE (no ConfigServer), CfgServerQueue auto-creates as a black hole →
AppStartMP blocks forever, never reaching X/spawn. So AppStartMP's FIRST gate is the **config round-trip =
blocker #6**, the SAME frontier as IPO; the constellation spawn is GATED behind it.
With **ConfigServer added to the namespace** (it must start first = task 0x100; AppStartMP becomes 0x107),
AppStartMP **CONNECTS to ConfigServer under FEX exactly like IPO**: `INJECT_ACK: posted
CfgClientIsConnected(success=OK) to "0-0000107CfgM"`. It then PROCEEDS PAST config into its **PLIB++ GUI
init** (PLib++ = HEIDENHAIN's X11 GUI toolkit, the boot-splash layer): `PLib++ Error: Unable to load the
default keyboard map / character map / function key map` (missing PLIB++ keymap data files), and it never
opens the X display (Xvfb logs 0 client connections). AppStartMP then busy-spins in its GUI event-dispatch
loop (`Ev_receive(0x01011001, ANY, timeout=0)` polled 4.9M× in 45s) waiting for a GUI event that never
comes, and does NOT fork heuseradmin / spawn the constellation. ⇒ AppStartMP's gates UNDER FEX are now
pinned: **config(#6) [PASSED via ConfigServer+INJECT_ACK] → PLIB++ GUI boot [the wall]**. The constellation
spawn (heuseradmin fork) is behind a working PLIB++ GUI = the documented full-GUI/Qt-MMI frontier (keymap
data + a live X render + the GUI toolkit). The heuserver/foundation work is READY for when the spawn fires,
but the spawn is gated on the GUI layer, not on the now-up servers. This extends today's cross-process
connect proof (IPO) to AppStartMP, and locates the remaining frontier precisely at PLIB++ GUI init. (Minor:
the GUI-not-ready poll is a busy Ev_receive(timeout 0) loop — run with HEROSCALL_VERBOSE=0 to avoid the
multi-GB trace; not the real blocker.)

★★ AppStartMP PLIB++ KEYMAP WALL CLEARED — GUI resource init now CLEAN; wall moved one layer deeper to the
GUI EVENT PUMP (2026-06-22, `emulator/run_appstart_fex.sh`). The PLIB++ "Unable to load the default
keyboard/character/function key map!" errors (the documented wall in commit 5e35f0c) are GONE. ROOT CAUSE
(host-strace pinned it): AppStartMP loads the GUI resource set from `%SYS%\resource\{keymap,charmap,
functionkeymap}_us101.xml` (+ `default_theme.xrs`/`tnc640_theme.xrs` + button bitmaps), and TWO things broke it:
(1) the script staged only `config/`+`batch/` into the writable SYS mirror, **never `resource/`**; (2) the
control opens the **LITERAL, UNEXPANDED `%SYS%/resource/...`** path — `PReplacePath`'s percent-macro table is
unpopulated standalone, so `%SYS%`/`%OEM%`/`%USR%` are NOT substituted (only the `\`→`/` convert happens). This
is the SAME `%SYS%`/`%OEM%` non-substitution as blocker #6. FIX: (a) `cp -aL $CFG/resource $SYSW/resource`;
(b) a literal `/%SYS%`→/tmp/s symlink (the open is relative to cwd=/), + `/%OEM%`,`/%USR%`. strace CONFIRMS:
`openat("%SYS%/resource/keymap_us101.xml")=9`, charmap=9, functionkeymap=9, themes/bmps fd 9/10 — all OPEN,
zero keymap errors. (Diagnostics added: `emulator/openlog.c` LD_PRELOAD open-logger — but as a GUEST preload it
PERTURBED AppStartMP's timing-sensitive startup so it never connected; use HOST `strace -f -e openat,newfstatat`
instead, which is non-invasive and proven to see FEX guest syscalls.)
★ NEW WALL (precisely pinned, the documented full-GUI frontier): with resources loading, AppStartMP completes
RTOS init + config connect (INJECT_ACK) + internal queue/task setup, then BLOCKS in its PLIB++ GUI event pump:
**`Ev_receive(0x01011001, EV_NOWAIT)` polled 1,518,645× in 45s**, reading the HeROS **`/dev/events`** input/event
device (herosapi_shim fakes the open + stubs `ioctl(0x4502)→0`, so NO events are delivered). Standalone the
awaited event `0x01011001` is never posted → AppStartMP **never connects to X (Xvfb = 0 client connections)** and
**never forks the constellation** (no spawn/FmLoad/heuseradmin/applaunch anywhere in the 1.5M-line trace). So the
gate is now the GUI EVENT SOURCE feeding the pump (which precedes X-connect AND spawn), not the keymap load.
NEXT (the natural frontier, within the documented GUI frontier): RE which event the pump must capture to proceed —
a candidate for an INJECT-style `Ev_send(0x01011001)` (like INJECT_ACK was for config), OR delivering real input
events through `/dev/events` (ioctl 0x4502). Deeper GUI RE, but the wall is pinned to the exact awaited event.

★★★★ GUI EVENT PUMP RE'd + BUSY-SPIN FIXED → AppStartMP CONNECTS TO X + spawns the LogoModule thread
(2026-06-22). The `Ev_receive(0x01011001)` pump is **libbackend.so's EVHandler dispatcher** (decompiled to
`work/re/out/{AppStartMP.elf,libbackend.so}.decomp.c`): `handlesysevents@0x3d990` does
`ev_receive((registered_waitables & ~disabled), 2, 0)` and `EVHandlerWaitForIOEvent@0x3db60` does
`select()` on the registered fds. **`0x01011001` = OR of the registered "waitable" event-bits** (each timer/
queue/the `/dev/events` sysevent fd gets a unique bit via `FWaitableList::GetUniqueEventId`); it is NOT a
single magic event. `/dev/events` is the HeROS **sysevent readiness signaler** the dispatcher select()s on
(`open("/dev/events")` → `EVHandlerRegisterFile(...,handlesysevents,...)` → `ioctl(fd,0x4502,&mask)` sets the
enabled-sysevent mask; the kernel driver then makes the fd readable AND `ev_send`s the bit when a sysevent
fires). ★ ROOT CAUSE of the busy-spin: `herosapi_shim` backed `/dev/events` with an **always-readable 4 MB
memfd** → `select()` returned ready EVERY iteration → the dispatcher busy-spun `ev_receive(0x01011001,2,0)`
(1.5M polls/45s) and NEVER blocked, starving the entire GUI/logo/X bring-up. ★ FIX (`emulator/herosapi_shim.c`,
env-gated `HEROS_EVENTS_PIPE=1`): back `/dev/events` with a **blocking pipe** (read-end; write-end held open so
it is not EOF-ready) → `select()` blocks until an event is injected. ★★ RESULT — the fix CASCADED into real
boot progress: busy-spin GONE (0 polls; log 1.5M→310 lines), and AppStartMP now **spawns task 0x108 = the
LogoModule thread** (`T_create 0x108 parent 0x106` → `T_start` → resumed), which creates the **`logo`** queue
(0x313) + its CfgMailslot queues, idents `AppStartMaster`(0x306), and **CONNECTS TO X**:
`connect(8, {AF_UNIX, "/tmp/.X11-unix/X99"}) = 0` (previously Xvfb had 0 client connections). It runs the
AppStartMaster↔logo init exchange (5 Q_read 0x306 / 4 Q_send 0x313), then BLOCKS CLEANLY on
**`Ev_receive(0x01019007, timeout=0xffffffff)`** (a real forever-wait, not a poll). So the always-readable
`/dev/events` memfd was the genuine blocker of the whole logo/X layer. ★ NEW FRONTIER: AppStartMP connects to
X + inits the logo, then blocks on `Ev_receive(0x01019007)` BEFORE spawning the constellation (**execve count
= 0** — no subsystem launched yet). The next gate = the event that drives the logo→spawn transition (likely
the X-render / window-manager handshake completion, the logo thread's "displayed" confirm back to
AppStartMaster, or a HeROS sysevent). INJECTION HOOK now in place: `herosapi_shim` keeps the `/dev/events`
pipe **write-end** (`events_wr_fd`) — a synthetic sysevent = write to wake `select()` + `ev_send` the bit (the
next experiment, like INJECT_ACK was for config). ★ HARNESS NOTE: do NOT pipe FEX through `| head` under
`timeout strace …` — when `timeout` SIGKILLs `strace`, FEXInterpreter DETACHES (a tracee survives a dead
tracer) and holds the pipe open → the script deadlocks (cost me a 33-min hang). Use a `> file` redirect +
explicit `pkill -KILL -x FEXInterpreter` to reap the detached process.

★★★ AppStartMP PRE-SPAWN GATE pinned + EVENT-INJECTION drives the boot sequencer (2026-06-22). After the X
connect + logo bring-up, AppStartMP's main thread (**heros task 0x106 = AppStartMaster**) reads its initial
messages (queue 0x306, relayed to the `logo` queue 0x313) — the senders to 0x306 are the **config layer**
(`notify -> task 0x100` = ConfigServer) — then blocks in **heros `Ev_receive(0x01019007, timeout=0xffffffff)`**
before spawning the constellation (**execve = 0**, no subsystem launched). Two injection experiments
(`emulator/run_appstart_fex.sh` knobs, both gated OFF by default):
  • **`HEROSCALL_SELECT_CAP_MS` (herosapi_shim select() cap)** — NO effect (log identical, 310 lines). The
    gate is a heros EVENT-wait, NOT a `select()`/framework-timer wait, so capping the dispatcher select is
    the wrong lever. (The startup `FModule::CreateTimer` ~12s/~54s are serviced elsewhere, not this block.)
  • **`HEROSCALL_EV_UNBLOCK_MS` (heros_rtos: force a forever event-wait to return its `want` after N ms)** —
    DROVE the boot: the forced event made `FThread::DispatchEvents -> FWaitableList::NotifyAll ->
    FWaitableEvent::Notify -> FModule::DispatchMessage` deliver an **`FmEvent` to the `AppStart::Monitor`
    sequencer module** (the boot driver). So the boot IS event-drivable past X/logo. BUT returning the FULL
    want-mask over-notified an unarmed `FWaitableInput` -> fatal assert **`0 < mask` (fwaitable.cpp:248)** in
    `FWaitableInput::Unmask`. ⇒ precise SINGLE-event injection (the exact awaited waitable bit) is required;
    blind bit-guessing is fatal (the assert aborts), so the next step is RE'ing `AppStart::Monitor`'s exact
    awaited waitable. The real subsystem SET still comes from the config-data round-trip (**#6**, the empty
    DataStore layers / productid / SIK), the SAME deep frontier as IPO — so the busy-spin fix carried
    AppStartMP all the way to the shared config-data gate (X + logo + config-connect en route), and the
    constellation spawn needs BOTH the precise boot-sequencer event AND the config data. Gated probes left in
    place (`herosapi_shim.c` select-cap, `heros_rtos.c` ev-unblock) for the next iteration.

★★ AppStartMP SPAWN GATE — characterized precisely (2026-06-24, config #6 now solved + IDA RE of AppStartMP.elf).
With ConfigServer carrying `cfgfix.so` (config #6 SOLVED — see blocker #6), `run_appstart_fex.sh` was rerun:
AppStartMP CONNECTS to ConfigServer (config served, INJECT_ACK to 0-0000107CfgM), connects to X (X99), runs the
AppStartMaster↔logo exchange — but **STILL blocks at `Ev_receive(0x01019007)` with ZERO constellation execve**
(all 12 execve are FEXInterpreter/cat/cut/env/grep). ⇒ **config #6 was NOT the spawn gate** (it's needed by the
constellation CHILDREN, but the spawn TRIGGER is separate). IDA RE of `AppStart::Monitor` (idalib headless on
AppStartMP.elf): the spawn fires in `Monitor::OnEvent@0x3d6d0` when it receives the **`CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM`**
event (`AppStart::Subsystems::GetEvent_CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM@0x5e280`, id set by static init) → `FmAppStartAction`
→ spawn. CRUCIALLY: events reach the Monitor as **MESSAGES on its input queue 0x306** (`Monitor::DispatchMessage
@0x3e220` routes type **0x40C80080** → OnEvent), NOT as raw Ev_receive bits. The runtime trace shows the Monitor
spends ~80s cycling the **logo-init exchange** (`Q_read 0x306` ↔ `Q_send 0x313` to the LogoModule thread task
0x108), reaching the final `Ev_receive(0x01019007)` wait only at the very END — i.e. **the logo→spawn handshake
never completes headlessly** (the LogoModule never confirms "displayed"; needs a real X render/WM map event). So
CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM is never posted. WORKAROUNDS TRIED: (a) `HEROSCALL_EV_UNBLOCK_MS` (return full want-mask) →
trips the `0<mask` assert (prior session); (b) NEW targeted bit injection `HEROSCALL_EV_INJECT_WANT/_BIT`
(heros_rtos.c — return ONLY want&bit for the exact wait) → does NOT fire because the Monitor returns early on real
logo events (0x01000000) and only reaches the 0x01019007 wait near the run's end (<inject-delay). ⇒ DEFINITIVE:
the spawn gate is the **GUI logo-render handshake** + the spawn event being a **MESSAGE** (FmEvent 0x40C80080 on
queue 0x306), not an event bit. CORRECT next step = synthesize+inject the CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM FmEvent MESSAGE
onto 0x306 (INJECT-style, like INJECT_ACK — needs the FmEvent schema + the runtime event id), OR complete the
logo render so the handshake finishes. Both lead into the documented full-GUI/constellation frontier (92 procs +
HrMmi Qt render under FEX). The GOAL was reached via the yeen full-system route precisely because of this frontier.
Tooling: `heros_rtos.c` EV_INJECT knob; `run_appstart_fex.sh` (now with cfgfix on ConfigServer + cm=16 + the
/mnt/sys|plc/config staging).

★★★★★ GUI RENDERS — the real TNC640 "Startup Status" boot window draws LIVE under FEX-native ARM64
(2026-06-24, after the /dev/events bridge fix). With the bridge (commit bf0b579), AppStartMP's logo thread
t108 wakes on its queue notifies, drains the logo queue, connects to X (Xvfb :99), fully inits Xlib (fonts
NotoSansMono/urw-base35 + CJK cmaps + theme tnc640_theme.xrs.zip), and **DRAWS the "Startup Status" splash
window** (title bar + progress bar + window controls, decorated by openbox) — verified by an Xvfb screenshot
(`import -window root`; the run script now screenshots at +70/90/110s). This is the FIRST real TNC640 GUI
rendered via the FEX-native userspace path (NOT the yeen VirtualBox route). The render is genuine (50 writev
to the X socket, 97 ppoll, bounded — not a busy-loop).
★ NEXT GATE precisely mapped (the boot sequencer, idalib RE of AppStartMP.elf): `Monitor::Start@0x3b950`
posts an `FmCallProcedure` → the **Procedures module runs the batch `TNC640heros.txt`** (the 30-subsystem/
92-process constellation def; FIRST entries = config FmCommandLineOptions for jh.cfg/product.cfg/tnc.cfg, then
FmLoadSubsystem `winmgr` → `%EXECDIRH%/winmgr.elf`, then SkManager…). The chain (FChainModule: action flows
via FlushWorkspace through Monitor→Procedures→Config→Subsystems→Progress→LogoLink→EndOfChain) emits
FmLoadSubsystem; `Subsystems::OnMessage` registers the processes in `AppStart::Processes`; `Monitor::OnEvent@
0x3d6d0` runs `ScanChildStat@0x3c8b0` (the spawn engine: `if GetNumberOfProcesses()!=0 while(1){ GetProcess
State → emit FmSubsystemAction(5/6) }` → fork+execve) on a `NEXT_CHILDSTAT`/`CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM` event.
DECISIVE runtime finding (VERBOSE): AppStartMP (task t106) renders, then loops `Ev_receive(0x01009007,poll)
→ Q_read → Q_send(52B) → Q_ident` against **CfgServerQueue** = the **config-READ phase** (reading its startup
config jh/product/tnc.cfg via the GetData round-trip), then blocks `Ev_receive(0x01019007,forever)` — it
**NEVER reaches the winmgr FmLoadSubsystem** (execve=0, no Tm_ timers). ⇒ the current gate is the **config-DATA
round-trip for AppStartMP's OWN startup config** (the SAME frontier as config #6 / IPO's -k=NC, now for
AppStartMP) — ConfigServer must fully serve AppStartMP's GetData requests so the chain advances to the spawn.
Beyond that lies the constellation spawn (winmgr.elf → 91 more procs, each its own FEX+heros_rtos → HrMmi) =
the documented full-system frontier. Tooling: idalib (`scratchpad/idalibvenv` + `work/re/scripts/idadecompile.py`)
cleanly decompiles AppStartMP.elf where Ghidra's exception-`.cold` split garbled it. Run: `run_appstart_fex.sh`
(HSTRACE + Xvfb screenshots).

★★ CONFIG-SERVE + SPAWN-GATE investigation (2026-06-24, after the render). Goal: get AppStartMP past its
config-read so the chain reaches `fork+execve(winmgr.elf)`. FOUR real fixes landed (all committed): (1) cfgfix
was SILENTLY NOT LOADING in run_appstart_fex.sh — it used `dlsym(RTLD_NEXT)`+`-ldl` (dlsym@GLIBC_2.34) which
broke the FEX preload; removed dlsym (the real IsSysFile/IsOemFile are always-broken standalone, so the
resolved-prefix classification IS the correct impl). (2) cfgfix path-prefix mismatch — the run resolves config
under `/tmp/s/config` but `CFGFIX_SYS=/mnt/sys/`; made cfgfix match a COLON-separated prefix list. With both,
ConfigServer LOADS config + reaches its serve loop + ANSWERS AppStartMP (Q_read 57B → Q_ident reply queue →
Q_send 28B). (3) `heros_rtos` Q_create now UPGRADES a no-notify PLACEHOLDER queue to its real notify owner —
ConfigServer (starting first) created "AppStartMaster" with notify=0/owner=ConfigServer, so AppStartMP's own
chain events notified ConfigServer not itself; now `QS[306] notify=01000000->AppStartMP`. (4) INJECT_REREAD now
fires on the serve-loop-fallback run-up path too (post_inject_reread), + chmod/unshare fake gates split
(HEROS_FAKE_CHMOD vs _NS) so the SetWritePermission chmod exception in ReadConfigDataSet can be neutralized
without the unshare fake making encDir read an empty store. ★ DECISIVE finding: AppStartMP **NEVER opens the
batch file `TNC640heros.txt`** (the 30-subsystem/92-proc constellation def) — it's stuck in its INIT config-read
BEFORE `Monitor::Start` posts the FmCallProcedure that runs the batch. So the spawn chain (FmLoadSubsystem →
Subsystems → ScanChildStat → fork+execve) is downstream of a gate not yet cleared: ConfigServer's config
cascade loads the `jhAttrFiles` (.atr schemas) + `jhUpdateFiles` (update*.cfg) but NOT the `jhDataFiles`
(tnc.cfg/jh.cfg/product.cfg — the actual config DATA, listed in jhconfigfiles.cfg's CfgJhConfigDataFiles), even
though those files are present + volume-resolvable (/mnt/sys/config/tnc.cfg, /mnt/plc/config/channel.cfg). The
standalone cfgfix run (run_2proc_cfgfix.sh) DID load tnc.cfg ("20+ data files"); the difference is in
ReadConfigDataDir's jhDataFiles handling and is non-deterministic w.r.t. the chmod-exception/version-write-back
path (faking chmod changes the loaded-file count 16→1) — the deep config #6 cascade-completeness frontier. ⇒
CURRENT FRONTIER: the FEX-native constellation spawn is gated on ConfigServer fully loading+serving AppStartMP's
init config (jhDataFiles), the documented config #6 frontier; the render + the 4 fixes are real groundwork.
Run: `run_appstart_fex.sh`.

★★★★ jhDataFiles SKIP *SOLVED* → AppStartMP NOW READS THE BATCH (2026-06-24, IDA on libConfigSystem.so).
The "config #6 cascade-completeness / chmod-non-determinism" framing above is SUPERSEDED — the real cause was
a clean code gate. `CfgServer::ReadConfigDataSet@0x229d50` UNCONDITIONALLY clears every layer (`while
GetNextLayer→ClearLayer`) then calls `ReadDataFiles(this,dir,START,false)`. `ServerHelper::SetupDirInfo@0x2a2a60`
registers jhDataFiles at the LOW indices [2..2+N) and the .atr/update lists at the HIGH indices; START is chosen
at `0x229e0f`: `cmp byte[this+0x169],0` (=CfgErrorParser+9, the "config-version-changed/full-reread" flag); `mov
eax,2`; `cmovz eax,edi` — flag!=0 → START=2 (full load incl jhDataFiles), flag==0 → START=ConfigDataDir(~17) =
SKIP jhDataFiles. FIRST read (fresh version) sets the flag → loads all; once the version is WRITTEN BACK a later
reread sees a matching version → flag==0 → the unconditional layer-clear WIPES jhDataFiles and does NOT reload
them (THAT is the multi-proc destructive reread; ConfigServer ALONE loaded 15/15 jhDataFiles in BOTH /mnt and
/tmp envs — proven via strace, so never path/env related). FIX = `emulator/cfgfix.c` runtime-NOPs the `cmovz`
(0f 44 c7→90 90 90) in the guest's mapped libConfigSystem.so so START is ALWAYS 2 (full load every reread);
constructor finds the base in /proc/self/maps, verifies the bytes, mprotect+patch (gated CFGFIX_FORCE_FULLLOAD,
default ON). VERIFIED under FEX (`run_appstart_fex.sh` + an openat-strace diag, commit after f78174e): patch
APPLIES in standalone AND the appstart ctx; ConfigServer opens ALL 15 jhDataFiles (99 config opens) and
broadcasts the FULL config (2×4380B + 1523/647/513B); and **AppStartMP NOW OPENS THE BATCH `TNC640heros.txt`
(8×) — config-read COMPLETES, Monitor::Start RUNS** (this directly clears the goal's stated gate "init
config-read never completes / never opens the batch"). ⇒ NEW (downstream, SEPARATE) gate: the spawn still does
not fire (execve=0 winmgr) — AppStartMP's traced activity in the run is ENTIRELY the LOGO bring-up (only t10d's
logo/Q_WMGRMSG/CfgM queues; NO Subsystems/Processes/Procedures module queues), and t10b (AppStartMaster) blocks
`Ev_receive(0x01019007)` for the logo "displayed" confirm while t10d renders the "Startup Status" window + drains
its logo queue but never signals t10b back. So the chain stalls at the **logo→AppStartMaster display-confirm
handshake** BEFORE Procedures-runs-batch→FmLoadSubsystem→spawn = the documented GUI-render frontier (NOT config —
config is now fully served). EV_INJECT/EV_FORCE of t10b's 0x10000 bit did not advance it (bit-injection ≠ the actual chain message). A 260s
run CONFIRMS it is a HARD deadlock, NOT a watchdog-escapable stall: t10b's `Ev_receive(0x01019007)` is INFINITE
(to=inf, no timeout), it is only ever woken by the `0x1000` logo ping-pong (caught 0x00001000), and it never
advances — 0 Tm_ timers, 0 winmgr execve even at 260s. `AppStart::LogoLink::OnMessage(FmProgressNotify)@0x20c50`
is the AppStartMaster-side consumer: a VALID FmProgressNotify (`IsValid(+64)` && `*(+72)!=0`) → FlushWorkspace
(chain advances); an invalid one → it re-posts FmLogoStartup (retry). So the precise next lever = inject a VALID
FmProgressNotify into AppStartMaster's chain (INJECT_ACK-style — needs the msg id/schema + target queue), or make
the logo's PWaitableDisplay (X MapNotify/Expose) fire its "displayed" confirm. Both are the documented GUI-render
frontier (the reason the live MMI was reached via yeen). Run: `run_appstart_fex.sh`; diags in
`scratchpad/run_appstart_{diag,inject,force,long}.sh`.
★ RULED OUT (cheap levers, all confirmed NOT the crack — don't repeat): (1) EV_INJECT elapsed bit-injection of
t10b's 0x10000 — no fire/effect; (2) EV_FORCE immediate bit-return of t10b's 0x10000 — returns the bit but the
dispatcher finds no real message behind it → re-waits (bit ≠ the chain message); (3) 260s long run — `Ev_receive
(0x01019007)` is INFINITE (no watchdog), 0 Tm_, 0 spawn; (4) NO window-manager (openbox skipped, to rule out
reparenting hiding MapNotify/Expose) — identical deadlock, so the WM isn't it. ⇒ the gate is the FModule GUI
sync (the t10b↔t10d `0x1000` USEREVMASK ping-pong + the logo "displayed" confirm) which lives in **libbackend.so /
PLib** (FmProgressNotify is a thunk imported from there, NOT in AppStartMP.elf), so the next real attempt needs
that binary in IDA to decode the confirm message/handshake. This is the documented GUI frontier; the config half
(jhDataFiles → batch read) is fully solved + verified upstream of it.

★★★★ SPAWN GATE TRACED TO THE ROOT (2026-06-24, IDA on AppStartMP.elf + libbackend.so + message-level RTOS
trace): with the cfgfix full-load fix the config half is DONE; the spawn gate is now pinned through every layer.
TOOLING: added `heros_rtos.c` HSTRACE message **type-tag + printable-ASCII** dump (commit) → decoded the exact
GMessages on AppStartMaster's queues. FINDINGS: (1) the chain LIVELOCKS cycling ONE message type **0x40c803e0 =
`FmProcessState`** (id→handler map from `Monitor::DispatchMessage@0x3e220`: 0x40c80080=FmEvent→OnEvent,
0x40c80060=FmCommandLineOption→OnOption, 0x40c80420=FmTimer→OnTimer, 0x40c803e0=FmProcessState→OnMessage). (2)
`Monitor::OnMessage(FmProcessState)@0x3c400`: state==2 && **action==0 && pending==1** → emit `FmSubsystemAction
(1=start)` → fork. (3) `AppStart::Processes::OnMessage(FmProcessState)@0x50450`: if the process isn't in
`childProcesses` (= not forked by AppStartMP) it logs "Cannot track unknown process" and does NOT signal
`NEXT_CHILDSTAT` (the only other ScanChildStat trigger; `ScanChildStat@0x3c8b0` is ONLY reachable from
`Monitor::OnEvent`). (4) The cycling FmProcessState (wire `e003c840|02000000|…|name@+16`) carries the name
**"cfgserver:"** — the heros name of the **pre-launched ConfigServer**, which matches NO registered subsystem
("Server:~/cfgserver") → "unknown process", ignored; removing the pre-launched ConfigServer changes nothing
(intrinsic, not interference). (5) DIRECT INJECTION PROBE (`HEROSCALL_INJECT_WINMGR`, heros_rtos.c): synthesize a
structurally-valid `FmProcessState(name="winmgr:~/winmgr", state=2)` onto the AppStartMaster queue — it FIRES,
delivers, and flows through the chain to the logo EXACTLY like a real one, but produces **no FmSubsystemAction/
fork** ⇒ `GetIndexOfSubsystem("winmgr:~/winmgr")@0x5f610` finds nothing = **winmgr is NOT registered**. ROOT GATE:
AppStartMP READS the batch (8 opens) but its **`FmLoadSubsystem` entries never reach `Subsystems::OnMessage`
@0x606b0** — no subsystem is registered, so nothing can be started/forked. The FModule boot chain (Procedures
parses the batch but the FmLoadSubsystem messages don't flow to the Subsystems stage) is the precise gate =
the documented multi-process-constellation/FModule-boot frontier. Next levers (each deep): inject the
`FmLoadSubsystem` set to register the subsystems THEN the FmProcessState to start them, or RE why
Procedures→Subsystems doesn't flow. Probes: `HEROSCALL_INJECT_WINMGR` (+ `_NAME`), DUMPQ/HSTRACE tag+ascii;
runs `scratchpad/run_appstart_{diag,winmgr,nocfg,dumpq}.sh`.

★ SPAWN MECHANISM FULLY RE'd (idalib on AppStartMP.elf) + the LOGO-THREAD block pinned (2026-06-24):
the constellation spawn is driven by **`FmLoadSubsystem` messages** → `AppStart::Subsystems::OnMessage
@0x606b0`: it looks up the subsystem by name (+12), reads its process-LIST size (+72); if the list is
NON-EMPTY it **registers the processes for spawning** (the real subsystems), if EMPTY it signals
`CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM` (a finalizer, NOT the trigger for the real procs). So `CREATE_VOID_SUBSYSTEM`
injection alone would NOT spawn the constellation — the real spawn needs the `FmLoadSubsystem` messages
(from `batch/TNC640heros.txt`) to reach `Subsystems::OnMessage`. Those are gated behind the logo. ★ The
LOGO thread (task **0x108 = the `logo` queue 0x313 owner**) is pinned: after creating 0x313 it spins a tight
**`Ev_send(0x108,0x1000) → poll → Ev_send(0x106,0x1000) → wait 0x1000`** ping-pong with AppStartMaster
(task 0x106) — a PLIB++ GUI inter-thread sync loop — and **NEVER drains queue 0x313** (depth grows 1→2→3
as AppStartMaster relays to it). So the logo handshake never completes headlessly (the 0x1000 barrier never
releases — it needs the actual logo render/confirm), the sequencer never advances to dispatch the
`FmLoadSubsystem` set, and 0 constellation processes execve. ConfigServer (with cfgfix) DOES load + broadcast
the full config (4380/647/616/516-byte payloads), so config is NOT the gate. ⇒ The remaining gate is the
**PLIB++ logo-render / GUI inter-thread sync (0x1000 ping-pong on task 0x108)** — the documented GUI-render
frontier. Reachable next attempts (all deep, against the frontier): (a) inject the `FmLoadSubsystem` set
directly to `Subsystems::OnMessage`'s queue (bypass the logo — needs the FmLoadSubsystem schema + the batch
content); (b) make the logo thread's 0x1000 barrier release / complete the X render; (c) RE the logo→spawn
state transition. This is the precisely-pinned FEX-native AppStartMP endpoint; the full constellation + HrMmi
Qt render under FEX remains the documented frontier (reached via the yeen full-system route).

★★★★★ SPAWN ACHIEVED via GMessage INJECTION — the FEX-native constellation COMES UP (2026-06-24). The above
"FmLoadSubsystem never reaches Subsystems::OnMessage / logo deadlock" gate is now BYPASSED: instead of waiting
for the chain, the emulator INJECTS the constellation directly. Three pieces (committed): (1) **full GMessage
serializer** in `emulator/heros_rtos.c` (FmLoadProcess id 0xc80161 / FmLoadSubsystem 0xc80181 / FmSubsystemAction
0xca0060; wire format RE'd from libgmsglib via IDA — recursive type-id dwords, GMsgString 0xe7/GMsgInt 0x63/
GMsgList 0x18c present-empty/GMsgEnum); `HEROSCALL_INJECT_FMLOAD_SET=<file>` reads "localNS/proc|/tmp/b/<img>"
per line (run script generates all 92 from `batch/TNC640heros.txt`) and posts an FmLoadProcess for EACH onto
AppStartMaster → chain → `Processes::OnMessage` → `p_ident`(-1) → `IsAFile` → `PCreate`→`p_create`. (2)
**create-mode gate RE'd** (`PCreatePrepare@0x45460`): FmLoadProcess attr6/GMsgInt PRESENT → mode 3 (Remote,
no fork); ABSENT → mode 0 = fork. So inject with attr6 ABSENT (`HEROSCALL_INJECT_FMLOAD_PRESENT=0`). (3)
**p_create FEX-spawn interposer** (`emulator/herosapi_shim.c`, `HEROS_PCREATE_FEX=1`): the real p_create's
`clone(CLONE_VM|VFORK 0x4111,callback)`+child-execve(i386 image) STALLS under FEX (forked-JIT-child i386 exec
re-wrap hangs in /proc/self/fd); replace with plain `fork()`+`execve` of the NATIVE `/usr/bin/FEXInterpreter
<image>` (native exec = no re-wrap, like AppStartMP's cat/grep helper forks). Sub-fixes: NO rootfs symlink for
FEXInterpreter (a symlink makes FEX loop infinitely re-prefixing; rely on rootfs-ENOENT fallback to the real
binary), translate the image `/tmp/b/X`→`$R/heros5/bin/X` (the nested FEX rootfs-prefixes), `chmod +x` every
staged image (p_create does `access(X_OK)`). RESULT (`run_appstart_fex.sh`, MAX=8 = VM-resource guard; full 92
would OOM): **8 distinct subsystems FORK+LAUNCH+RUN** (winmgr, skmgr, promview, evtserver, evtviewer, observer,
hwserver, ConfigServer), each under a fresh nested FEXInterpreter + the heros emulator, doing REAL RTOS init —
proven by the 21 named queues they create (`Q_WMGR`/`Q_WMGRMSG`, `Q_SkMgr`/`Q_SkMgrCtrl`, `QProMViewer`/
`QProMRequest`, `QHWServer*`/`SikServer`/`SikHwSrv`, `ObserverQ` + per-process `CfgM` config-client mailslots),
0 crashes, real /etc/passwd guard intact. So the FEX-native constellation spawn IS realized via injection; each
subsystem then blocks at its own GUI/peer handshake (the documented multi-thread-GUI / 92-proc+HrMmi frontier),
but they are STARTED + RTOS-initialized. Run: `HEROSCALL_INJECT_SUBSYS=0 HEROSCALL_INJECT_FMLOAD_PRESENT=0
HEROS_PCREATE_FEX=1 HEROSCALL_INJECT_FMLOAD_SET=/tmp/fmload_set.txt HEROSCALL_INJECT_FMLOAD_MAX=8 bash
emulator/run_appstart_fex.sh`. Commits b1a0b31..1f100c3.

★★ DEADLOCK CRACKED OPEN to the EMULATOR-SEMANTICS mechanism (2026-06-24) — the logo handshake stalls
on an **FModule/FWaitableQueue event-id mismatch + a send-before-wait timing gap** in heros_rtos, NOT a GUI
render. Precise trace: AppStartMaster (task 0x106) relays config/batch messages to the logo's input queue
0x313 (owner = the logo thread 0x108) and self-wakes via `Ev_send(0x106, 0x1000)` (30×). The logo thread's
FModule dispatch **waits `Ev_receive(want=0x1000)`** (its FWaitableQueue's `GetUniqueEventId` bit), but the
emulator notifies queue-0x313 sends with the **flags-derived top byte `0x01000000`** (`flags 1000002 &
0xff000000`), which is NOT in the logo's `0x1000` wait → the logo wakes ONLY the 2× AppStartMaster sends
`0x1000` directly, then stalls; the queued messages pile up (depth grows) unread, so the logo never confirms
and AppStartMaster blocks forever on `Ev_receive(0x01019007)` for the logo-done/`0x10000` bit. (Contrast:
ConfigServer's CfgServerQueue notify `0x01000000` DOES overlap its owner's `0x01011000` wait, so it works —
the flags-byte heuristic is right there but wrong for the logo queue.) WORKAROUND IMPLEMENTED (`heros_rtos.c`,
committed): track each task's last `Ev_receive` want (`last_ev_want`); in Q_send, if the queue's flags-bit
isn't in the owner's current SINGLE-bit wait, notify THAT bit instead. PRINCIPLED + safe (ConfigServer
unchanged) but did NOT crack it — the Q_sends to 0x313 happen BEFORE the logo establishes its `0x1000` wait
(`last_ev_want` not yet set), so the retroactive match misses. ⇒ The genuine fix = faithfully replicate the
FModule/FWaitable **event-id binding** (per-queue `GetUniqueEventId` at registration, so Q_send notifies the
exact bit the owner will wait on) + the parent/child startup handshake ordering — substantial heros_rtos RTOS
RE. Also tooling: `HEROSCALL_EV_INJECT_WANT/_BIT` targeted single-bit event injection (returns only want&bit,
avoiding the `0<mask` assert) — fired into AppStartMaster's `0x01019007` wait with `0x10000` but AppStartMaster
reaches that wait only after ~5 messages in 150s (the deadlock crawls it), so injecting the final bit alone
can't spawn (the batch isn't processed). ⇒ CURRENT FRONTIER: the FEX-native constellation spawn needs a faithful
multi-thread FModule/FWaitable RTOS model (event-id binding + handshake) in the userspace emulator — the
emulator carries SINGLE processes far (config #6 SOLVED, IPO past -k=NC) but the multi-thread GUI FModule
handshake is the deep RTOS-semantics frontier, beyond which lies the 92-proc + HrMmi Qt render = the
documented full-system frontier (reached via yeen). This is the deepest, most precise pin of the FEX-native
AppStartMP gate to date.

★★★★★ DEADLOCK *SOLVED* (2026-06-24) — the gate was a MISSING `/dev/events` EVENT→FD BRIDGE, not an
event-id-binding bug. The 2026-06-24 "event-id mismatch" diagnosis above was a MISREAD; the real RE (decompile
of `GetUniqueEventId@0x3c2a0`, `EVHandlerCreateQueue@0x3e880`, kernel `Q_create@0x10aeb0`/`Q_send`+`Ev_sendtcb`,
`handlesysevents@0x3d990`, `EVHandlerHandleIOEvent@0x3dcb0`) proved: (1) the **per-queue event-id binding is
ALREADY faithful** — kernel `Q_create` sets `queue.notify_bits = flags & 0xff000000` gated on `flags&2`
(line 11129), EXACTLY the emulator's heuristic; `EVHandlerCreateQueue` allocates the queue's notify bit from
**OWNEVMASK (bits 24-31)** by scanning the EVHandler's used-mask and bakes it into the `flags` top byte, so the
logo queue 0x313 correctly notifies `0x01000000`; (2) the logo's `0x1000` is a **USEREVMASK handshake event**
(bits 0-15, `GetUniqueEventId` allows 0-15 + 24-31; 16-23 reserved), NOT the queue bit — the prior session
conflated them. The ACTUAL gate (found via a focused `HEROSCALL_HSTRACE` event/queue trace in `heros_rtos.c`):
the logo GUI thread t108 does NOT block in `Ev_receive` — it blocks in **`select()` on `/dev/events`** (the
HeROS sysevent signaler fd; `EVHandlerHandleIOEvent` NEVER `read()`s it, it is purely a select trigger). The
real kernel makes `/dev/events` READABLE when `Ev_sendtcb` delivers a matching sysevent; the emulator's
`ev_send` only set the event word + futex (which wakes an Ev_receive blocker, NOT a select() blocker), so a
queue notify (`0x01000000`) delivered to a select()-blocked GUI thread was LOST → t108 never read its logo
queue → t106 waited forever. `HEROS_EVENTS_PIPE=1` (the prior busy-spin fix) made it worse (blocking pipe that
nothing poked). FIX = the faithful event→fd bridge (`emulator/heros_rtos.c` + `herosapi_shim.c`): herosapi_shim
hands heros_rtos each thread's `/dev/events` pipe (rd,wr) + the `ioctl(0x4502)` enabled-sysevent mask; on every
event-word change `heros_rtos` reconciles that pipe's readability to `(pending events & (sysmask|OWNEVMASK)) !=
0` — readable EXACTLY when the kernel would signal, drained when consumed (via `evdev_reconcile` in `ev_send`
on the target + `ev_receive` on self). VALIDATED under FEX (`run_appstart_fex.sh`, HSTRACE): the deadlock is
GONE — t108 now waits on the full dispatcher mask `0x01011001`, **WAKES on the queue notify `0x01000000`,
DRAINS the logo queue 0x313** (5 msgs, bounded 4 self-re-arms, NO busy-spin), creates `Q_WMGRMSG`, **connects
to X (`connect(X99)=0`)**, and fully initializes Xlib (fonts NotoSansMono/urw-base35, CJK cmaps, theme
`tnc640_theme.xrs.zip`). ⇒ the multi-thread FModule/FWaitable RTOS handshake — the deep frontier the prior
session named — is now FAITHFULLY REIMPLEMENTED + working. The boot ADVANCED from the RTOS deadlock cleanly
into the **GUI-render layer**: t106 still waits `0x01019007` for the logo "displayed" confirm, and t108 (after
full Xlib init) blocks at the **X/WM expose-render handshake** = the documented GUI-render frontier (a DIFFERENT
layer than the RTOS event semantics; needs a real X expose/WM-map cycle that doesn't complete headlessly under
Xvfb). Tooling added: `HEROSCALL_HSTRACE=1` (+`_TASKS=`) compact event/queue/thread trace; `heros_evdev_register`
/`heros_evdev_setmask` bridge hooks. Also fixed a pre-existing `\$R`-unbound bug in `run_appstart_fex.sh` that
had prevented AppStartMP from launching at all.

★★★ FUSE WORKS UNDER FEX (2026-06-22) — refutes the earlier "encfs/FUSE fails under qemu" conclusion.
`emulator/run_fuse_test.sh`: the control's own i386 **encfs** mounts a FUSE filesystem under FEX, encrypts
a file (plaintext `hello-fuse-fex` → encrypted name `mvzrq09bdgQr3HDzX,BBEPes` in the source dir), and
round-trips it back through the decrypted view. `mount` shows `encfs on /tmp/dec type fuse.encfs`. So FEX
correctly translates the whole FUSE protocol (i386 encfs forks fusermount → mount() syscall + passes the
/dev/fuse fd via SCM_RIGHTS → encfs serves FUSE reqs over /dev/fuse) — qemu-user could NOT, FEX CAN.
Recipe: control's i386 encfs+fusermount+closure (libfuse/libssl/librlog/...) in $R; mount-ns as root with
/dev/fuse present; `printf pass | FEXInterpreter encfs --standard -S -f <src> <mnt>` (fusermount in PATH).
⇒ UNBLOCKS: (1) **heros-auth-daemon — NOW UP** (FUSE win applied): with the real daemon.conf (the empty one
gave "No daemon section" → no socket), it FUSE-mounts BOTH `/run/auth_daemon/certs` (cert store) and
`/run/auth_daemon/fs_mount` (token fs) and binds its `auth-daemon-srv.sock` (a unix DATAGRAM socket). The
[plugin_schlegel]/[plugin_eks] sections are HARDWARE RFID/key-switch readers (/dev/schlegel_rfid,
/dev/euchner_eks0) — optional, omitted (degrade w/o hardware). So 3 servers now run under FEX: dbus(S20),
auth-daemon(S23), heuserver(S77). (2) the **ConfigServer encfs config store** (blocker #6: `/mnt/sys/config/
jh_int` is an encfs mount; the "encfs fails under qemu / FUSE-unshare" sub-blocker is removed under FEX — the
remaining config gates were productid/layer/SIK, not FUSE). NEXT (one-by-one): the config store under FEX, or
AppStartMP (integration: heuserver+dbus+auth-daemon are now up).

★★★ heros_rtos (the HeROS RTOS emulator) WORKS UNDER FEX (2026-06-22) — the UNIFICATION.
`emulator/rtos_probe.c` (minimal heroscall ISSUER) under FEX + heros_rtos: `Sys_getenv(SYS) ret=0
out="/tmp/s"` and `T_ident(self) -> tid=256`. So the RTOS emulator's core heroscall path runs under FEX —
syscall(222) interposition, the /dev/shm control-segment init, Sys_getenv (env value), T_ident (task id).
⇒ FEX runs BOTH halves of the control on ARM64: the SYSTEM SERVICES (where qemu-USER crashed with
cpu_exec asserts — heuserver/dbus/auth-daemon, all now up under FEX) AND the RTOS COMPUTE processes
(NCK/ConfigServer, via heros_rtos — previously only under qemu-i386). One translator for the whole control,
faster + free of the qemu-user thread/signal limits. (heuserver crashed *with* heros_rtos only because it
is RTOS-FREE and installs its own SIGUSR1 handler that collides with heros_rtos's async-signal carrier — a
specific conflict, not a general failure; RTOS binaries that need heros_rtos work.) The heroscall-emulator
track (ConfigServer/IPO → the config #6 frontier, run under qemu-i386 in run_2proc_arm64.sh) can now move
to FEX. 
★★★★ CONFIRMED — ConfigServer RUNS THE FULL RTOS + ITS CONSTELLATION UNDER FEX (2026-06-22). Copied
ConfigServer's full closure (248 heros5/bin + 86 usr/lib libs, real files) into /var/tmp/lr. ONE glibc
bridge needed: **`arena_exclusive@GLIBC_2.0`** — a HEIDENHAIN-custom WEAK malloc-arena symbol their patched
control glibc-2.31 defines but the modern glibc (FEX needs it; bare 2.31 segfaults under FEX) lacks. A
versioned no-op stub (`emulator/arena_stub.c` + `arena.map`, `int arena_exclusive(void){return 0;}` exported
@GLIBC_2.0, LD_PRELOAD'd first) bridges it. RESULT: ConfigServer under FEX+heros_rtos does the FULL RTOS —
`[rtos] control segment created`, T_ident, all Sys_getenv, **Q_create CfgServerQueue(depth100,0x304) +
CfgFileMan/QSikInterface/AppStartMaster/QEvtServer**, **T_create/T_start task-creation rendezvous** (5 tasks
0x100-0x105), M_ident/M_attach IPO_SHARED_MEMORY, Q_send (size 647) — IDENTICAL to the qemu-i386 run-up.
⇒ THE UNIFICATION IS COMPLETE: the WHOLE control runs under FEX on ARM64 — system services (heuserver/dbus/
auth-daemon) AND the RTOS compute constellation (ConfigServer + tasks/queues), one translator, faster + free
of the qemu-user thread/signal limits. `emulator/run_2proc_arm64.sh` (qemu-i386) ports to FEX by: copy the
closure into the FEX rootfs, LD_PRELOAD `arena_stub.so:herosapi_shim.so:heros_rtos.so`, same env. NEXT: a
longer FEX run to reach the HWS stub / SIK / the config #6 frontier (same documented frontier as above, now under FEX),
or the 2-proc ConfigServer+IPO connect under FEX (cross-process futexes).
★★★★★ 2-PROCESS ConfigServer+IPO CONNECT WORKS UNDER FEX (2026-06-22) — cross-process futexes/queues PROVEN,
the last technical piece of the multi-process constellation under one translator. `emulator/run_2proc_fex.sh`
(the qemu-i386 `run_2proc_arm64.sh` ported to FEX). Result reproduces the documented qemu-i386 blocker-#6
frontier EXACTLY, with TWO independent FEXInterpreter processes sharing one `/dev/shm` RTOS namespace:
  • **ConfigServer** (bg) full run-up under FEX = **byte-for-byte the qemu-i386 baseline**: main task **0x100**,
    HWS stub fired (3.5s), 5 tasks (T_create/T_start rendezvous), 21 Q_create incl. **CfgServerQueue 0x304**
    (depth 100), 56 M_attach, M_attach IPO_SHARED_MEMORY. (Verified by a side-by-side qemu-i386 ConfigServer
    smoke run in the same VM: main 0x100 / HWS 1 / Q_create 21 / M_attach 56 / CfgServerQueue 0x304 — IDENTICAL.)
  • **IPO** (fg) attaches the SAME namespace and the CROSS-PROCESS IPC works: `M_attach "IPO_SHARED_MEMORY"`
    (the region ConfigServer created), `Q_ident "CfgServerQueue" -> 0x304`, **`Q_send -> 0x304` (IPO→ConfigServer,
    cross-process)**, then **`Q_read <- 0x30e`** = IPO reads the synthesized `CfgClientIsConnected(success=OK)`
    ACK from its reply queue (the semantic "Connected" — INJECT_ACK, blocker #5), then **multiple config
    request/reply round-trips** (`Q_send 0x304` ↔ `Q_read 0x30d/0x30e`, sizes 57/28/33/24/30), then
    **`Invalid Command Option -k`** = the config-data frontier (#6) — the EXACT documented qemu-i386 endpoint.
⇒ FEX correctly translates futex()/Q_send/Q_read on SHARED /dev/shm across two independent i386 processes.
The whole multi-process RTOS model (the constellation's IPC substrate) is proven under FEX. THREE CRITICAL
REPRO NOTES baked into the script: (1) the control segment is created under `sudo unshare`, so it is
ROOT-owned — clean `/dev/shm/heros_rtos_ctl`+`heros_reg_*` with **sudo** before each run, else a stale counter
makes ConfigServer's main task ≠ 0x100 and its hardcoded-0x100 run-up (AppStartMaster owner) breaks (no HWS
stub, no CfgServerQueue). (2) IPO's closure is BIGGER than ConfigServer's (graphics: needs i386 `libEGL.so.1`
+5 libs) — copy IPO's full closure with **`cp -aL`** (a dangling symlink makes the i386 loader fall back to the
host 64-bit lib → "wrong ELF class: ELFCLASS64"). (3) both procs run in ONE mount-ns (shared /dev/shm + /tmp)
with rootfs `/etc` bound over `/etc` (the FEX /etc-leak guard; md5 of real /etc/passwd verified unchanged).
Beyond `-k=NC` is the same documented config #6 / 92-proc / Qt-MMI frontier — now reachable under one translator.
(`heros5/bin/AppStartMP.elf`, needs Xvfb+openbox) forks heuseradmin which previously got "Connection
refused" — now heuserver is up. Full constellation = documented full-system/GUI frontier. ALWAYS run
heuserver CONTAINED (mount-ns) — unguarded = re-corrupts the VM. Recovery recipe (after VM restart):
rebuild preloads; FEX RootFS=/var/tmp/lr; `bash emulator/run_heuserver_fex.sh foreground`.
