# TNC640 on UNIX — Reverse‑Engineering & Documentation Project

Goal: understand the **HEIDENHAIN TNC 640 Programming Station** ("PGM‑Platz Virtual" /
virtual control, NC ident **340595**, version **18 SP4**) deeply enough to run it on
**UNIX‑like systems (Linux, macOS)** instead of only Windows.

A HEIDENHAIN TNC 640 is a CNC milling control. The *Programming Station* is the exact
same control software running inside a virtual machine on a PC, so you can write and
dry‑run G‑code / Klartext (conversational) NC programs without a real machine and without
wasting material. HEIDENHAIN ships it as a **Windows‑only** product. This project documents
how it is built and what it would take to run it elsewhere.

> **Status:** Architecture fully mapped **and** the real control now **boots on x86‑64 Linux**.
> Under VirtualBox 7.1 on an x86‑64 host the OVA installs the NC software and reaches the live
> TNC 640 MMI in demo mode, headless — verified, reproducible (see
> [docs/11](docs/11-running-on-linux.md)). Remaining: full input mapping and the PLC‑I/O (JHIO)
> question. See [`docs/`](docs/).

## ⚠️ Legal / what is (and isn't) in this repo

This repository contains **only original documentation and analysis**. It deliberately does
**not** contain any HEIDENHAIN or Oracle software. The downloaded package, the VM image, the
extension pack, the manuals, and everything extracted from them are proprietary and are
**git‑ignored** (`34059518SP4/`, `34059518/`, `work/`). Do not commit them. Full reasoning, including why
the documentation itself is lawful (EU interoperability rights) while redistributing the
binaries is not, is in **[docs/09-legal.md](docs/09-legal.md)**.

## TL;DR of findings

- The product is **VirtualBox + a hardened Linux guest (HeROS5) + a Qt host "Control Panel"**.
  The guest is the real TNC 640 control software; the Windows side is just orchestration.
- The **"steering panel"** (absent when the bare VMDK is booted) is a set of Qt host apps: `tncvbcntl.exe`
  (launcher), **`keypad.exe`** (on‑screen NC keyboard / soft keys), `handwheel.exe`
  (jog wheel), and `jhiosimhostd.exe` (PLC‑I/O simulation).
- Host↔guest is glued by **VirtualBox shared folders** (`Install`, `IOsim`, `PLC`, `TNC`),
  **guest properties** under `/HEIDENHAIN/*`, a guest **synthetic‑input daemon** (`heuinput`),
  a **handwheel TCP port `19035`**, and the **JHIO** PLC‑I/O service.
- It runs in **demo mode with no dongle and no hardware** (limited to 100 NC lines / 10 CAD
  elements) — which means *the VM is meant to run essentially standalone*.
- **Main constraint on ARM64 hosts (e.g. Apple Silicon):** the guest is **x86‑64**; Apple‑Silicon VirtualBox can't run
  x86 guests. The realistic path is a **Linux x86‑64 host**. Two host pieces are Windows‑only
  (the **JHIO extpack** and the **Qt control suite**) and would need to be substituted.
- **Done so far:** on an x86‑64 Linux host the control **installs and boots to the live MMI in
  demo mode, headless**, and responds to injected keypresses (soft keys = F1‑F8). Reproducible
  procedure in [docs/11](docs/11-running-on-linux.md); script `scripts/setup_vm.sh`.
